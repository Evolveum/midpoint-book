[quote, Alexandre Dumas]
All generalizations are dangerous, even this one.

MidPoint has many types of objects hard-coded: users, roles, orgs, services and many more.
However, no amount of hard-coded types could ever be enough to describe the vast diversity of the world around us.
Hence, there are _archetypes_, providing a mechanism to describe objects in finer details.

== Focal Objects

There are five basic types of _focal_ objects:

* *User* (`UserType`) represents users, usually as physical persons or personas.

* *Org* (`OrgType`) represents groups of other objects, such as organizational units, teams, projects or locations.

* *Role* (`RoleType`) represents roles, responsibilities or policies that can be applied to other objects.

* *Service* (`ServiceType`) represents non-human actors and assets, such as network services, applications and devices.

* *Generic object* (`GenericObjectType`) can represent anything else.

These are _focal_ types, because they can be a _focus_ of midPoint computation.
They are the _center_ of start topology, the _hub_ of the hub-and-spoke data mapping model that midPoint is using.
E.g. User has several linked accounts.
In midPoint parlance, _user_ is the _focus_, _accounts_ are _projections_.
User data can be mapped to accounts, account data can be mapped to user, but account cannot be mapped to another account.
That is the principle of the _star topology_.

We have already seen that.
However, _focal objects_ are meant to be much more than a mere center of data synchronization topology.
These objects are meant to have _business meaning_, to represent entities and concepts from the real world around us.
Almost every practical object, entity or concept can be classified to the first four types.
Physical persons, personas and other human-like identities can be represented as _users_.
Groups of other objects can be represented as _orgs_, such as organizations, organizational units, various types of teams, projects, classes, interest groups and task forces.
Even concepts that do not immediately come to mind can be represented as _orgs_, such as locations or nationalities.
Concept of _service_ can represent almost any _thing_, such as devices, network services, applications, databases, documents - even non-tangible _assets_ such as datasets or workspaces.
MidPoint _roles_ can be, quite obviously, used as roles for role-based access control (RBAC) purposes.
However, they can also represent business concepts, such as jobs, work positions and responsibilities.
_Roles_ can even represent very abstract concepts such as policies, classifications and clearances.
Almost anything that you can think of, anything which would be described as _identity_, could be classified in those four types: _user_, _org_, _role_ or _service_.
In a very rare case when a concept does not fit in any of these categories, there is always _generic object_ as a last resort.
However, the _user_-_org_-_role_-_service_ quartet works so well, that the _generic object_ was not really needed for years and years.

The four types are not just cosmetics, they have specific features that allow them to represent real-world concepts.

* *User* has several naming properties, such as _full name_ and _given name_, which are typical for natural persons.
It also has _credentials_ (e.g. password)

* *Org* can form hierarchies.
There can be _orgs_ in _orgs_, which is very useful for building organizational structures, or hierarchies of locations.

* *Role* is meant to grant privileges to users.

* *Service* has _credentials_, similarly to users.
Therefore, _service_ can represent machine agents, robots and similar _active_ things that behave like humans.
However, _service_ is meant to represent non-human identities, therefore it does not have human-like names.

This description is somehow simplified.
In reality, things are a bit more generic in midPoint.
_Roles_ are not the only type of objects that can grant privileges.
All role-like objects (known as _abstract roles_ in midPoint) have this ability, which means _orgs_ and _services_ can grant privileges too.
Also, all the four focal types can have _credentials_, at least in theory.
There is a significant overlap among the capabilities of the four object types.
However, the description above is a nice summarization of the _purpose_ for which the object types were created.

.Policy
TIP: MidPoint 4.9 is introducing another focal object type: _policy_ (`PolicyType`).
While policies can be represented by _roles_ (`RoleType`) in midPoint 4.8 and earlier, the new _policy_ type brings clarity.
In midPoint 4.9 and later, there is a clear distinction between quite concrete _role_ and very abstract _policy_.
This is a nice improvement, which improves thinking about _roles_ and _policies_ by optically separating them.
It also looks very good in user interface.
Other than that, _roles_ and _policies_ work exactly the same.
It is a curious thing, that sometimes even such apparently cosmetic change makes a big perceived difference.
We strongly recommend midPoint 4.9 to anyone who plans to heavily use _policies_, e.g. in deployments that need to address complex
_regulatory compliance_ scenarios.

== Archetypes

The four basic object types can represent almost anything we are likely to encounter in identity management world.
However, it does not mean that the four types fit all object types _perfectly_.
We often need to distinguish various nuances among object types.
E.g. we may want to use colors or icons to distinguish between _applications_, _mobile devices_ and _workspaces_.

// TODO: also slight differences in behavior, e.g. synchronize applications with enterprise application inventory, but not devices

// TODO: example archetype definition: custom color and icon

// TODO: archetype definitions in GUI

== Structural vs Auxiliary

// TODO

== User Archetypes

// TODO: pre-defined archetype: Person

// TODO: employees, externals, etc. - as auxiliary

== Role Archetypes

== Archetypes in Organizational Structure

TODO: divisions, departments, sections

TODO: archetype for projects, archetype for functional org.

TODO: assignment relation: allow project managers and owners, but not approvers.

TODO: just the basics, refer to org chapter for more details

== Service Archetypes

// TODO: application

== Meta-roles

// TODO: move section from RBAC chapter here
// TODO: Explain how archetypes act as meta-roles
