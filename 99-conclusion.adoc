== Conclusion

[quote, Steven Wright]
A conclusion is the place where you get tired of thinking.

This book is not finished yet.
In fact it is just a beginning.
The books is written continually in an incremental and iterative fashion as fast as time an money allow.

Your contributions and donations will surely speed up completion of this book.
Also consider getting midPoint subscription.
That is the source of funding for midPoint development.
Evolveum is no mega-corporation that can fund open source development from huge profits in other areas.
There are no other areas.
Evolveum is open-source-only company.
Everything we do is focused on open source projects.
Evolveum is not a start-up either.
We are not funded by venture capital and we do not have millions to spend.
Evolveum is a self-funded company.
We can spend only what we earn on subscriptions, sponsored features and services.
There is no other income.
MidPoint development can only go as fast as the money allow.
The same principle applies to midPoint documentation and this book.
It will grow proportionally to the Evolveum income.
Therefore if you liked this book please consider supporting us.
Both money and your time are more than appreciated.

We hope that you have enjoyed reading this book at least as much as we have enjoyed writing it â€“ and as we have enjoyed creating midPoint in the first place.
MidPoint is quite a unique software project and it would not be possible without you.
The whole Evolveum team would like to thank all past, present and future midPoint supporters for making this exciting project a reality.
Together we have created interesting and useful software product.
We hope that together we can make midPoint even better.

Thank you all.
