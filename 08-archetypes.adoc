[quote, Alexandre Dumas]
All generalizations are dangerous, even this one.

MidPoint has many types of objects hard-coded: _users_, _roles_, _orgs_, _services_ and many more.
However, no amount of hard-coded types could ever be enough to describe the vast diversity of the world around us.
Hence, there are _archetypes_, providing a mechanism to describe objects in finer details.

== Focal Objects

There are five basic types of _focal_ objects:

* *User* (`UserType`) represents users, usually as physical persons or personas.

* *Org* (`OrgType`) represents groups of other objects, such as organizational units, teams, projects or locations.

* *Role* (`RoleType`) represents roles, responsibilities or policies that can be applied to other objects.

* *Service* (`ServiceType`) represents non-human actors and assets, such as network services, applications and devices.

* *Generic object* (`GenericObjectType`) can represent anything else.

These are _focal_ types, because they can be a _focus_ of midPoint computation.
They are the _center_ of start topology, the _hub_ of the hub-and-spoke data mapping model that midPoint is using.
E.g. User has several linked accounts.
In midPoint parlance, _user_ is the _focus_, _accounts_ are _projections_.
User data can be mapped to accounts, account data can be mapped to user, but account cannot be mapped to another account.
That is the principle of the _star topology_.

image::04-05-user-bob-projections.png[Star topology]

We have already seen that.
However, _focal objects_ are meant to be much more than a mere center of data synchronization topology.
These objects are meant to have _business meaning_, to represent entities and concepts from the real world around us.
Almost every practical object, entity or concept can be classified to the first four types.
Physical persons, personas and other human-like identities can be represented as _users_.
Groups of other objects can be represented as _orgs_, such as organizations, organizational units, various types of teams, projects, classes, interest groups and task forces.
Even concepts that do not immediately come to mind can be represented as _orgs_, such as locations or nationalities.
Concept of _service_ can represent almost any _thing_, such as devices, network services, applications, databases, documents - even non-tangible _assets_ such as datasets or workspaces.
MidPoint _roles_ can be, quite obviously, used as roles for role-based access control (RBAC) purposes.
However, they can also represent business concepts, such as jobs, work positions and responsibilities.
_Roles_ can even represent very abstract concepts such as policies, classifications and clearances.
Almost anything that you can think of, anything which would be described as _identity_, could be classified in those four types: _user_, _org_, _role_ or _service_.
In a very rare case when a concept does not fit in any of these categories, there is always _generic object_ as a last resort.
However, the _user_-_org_-_role_-_service_ quartet works so well, that the _generic object_ was not really needed for years and years.

The four types are not just cosmetics, they have specific features that allow them to represent real-world concepts.

* *User* has several naming properties, such as _full name_ and _given name_, which are typical for natural persons.
It also has _credentials_ (e.g. password)

* *Org* can form hierarchies.
There can be _orgs_ in _orgs_, which is very useful for building organizational structures, or hierarchies of locations.

* *Role* is meant to grant privileges to users.

* *Service* has _credentials_, similarly to users.
Therefore, _service_ can represent machine agents, robots and similar _active_ things that behave like humans.
However, _service_ is meant to represent non-human identities, therefore it does not have human-like names.

This description is somehow simplified.
In reality, things are a bit more generic in midPoint.
_Roles_ are not the only type of objects that can grant privileges.
All role-like objects (known as _abstract roles_ in midPoint) have this ability, which means _orgs_ and _services_ can grant privileges too.
Also, all the four focal types can have _credentials_, at least in theory.
There is a significant overlap among the capabilities of the four object types.
However, the description above is a nice summarization of the _purpose_ for which the object types were created.

.Policy
TIP: MidPoint 4.9 is introducing another focal object type: _policy_ (`PolicyType`).
While policies can be represented by _roles_ (`RoleType`) in midPoint 4.8 and earlier, the new _policy_ type brings clarity.
In midPoint 4.9 and later, there is a clear distinction between quite concrete _role_ and very abstract _policy_.
This is a nice improvement, which improves thinking about _roles_ and _policies_ by optically separating them.
It also looks very good in user interface.
Other than that, _roles_ and _policies_ work exactly the same.
It is a curious thing, that sometimes even such apparently cosmetic change makes a big perceived difference.
We strongly recommend midPoint 4.9 to anyone who plans to heavily use _policies_, e.g. in deployments that need to address complex
_regulatory compliance_ scenarios.

== Archetypes

The four basic object types can represent almost anything we are likely to encounter in identity management world.
However, it does not mean that the four types fit all object types _perfectly_.
We often need to distinguish various nuances among object types.
E.g. we may want to use colors or icons to distinguish between _applications_, _mobile devices_ and _workspaces_.

Basic structure of archetype definition is simple:

[source,xml]
----
<archetype oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000702">
    <name>Person</name>
    <archetypePolicy>
        <display>
            <label>Person</label>
            <pluralLabel>Persons</pluralLabel>
            <icon>
                <cssClass>fa fa-user</cssClass>
                <color>green</color>
            </icon>
        </display>
    </archetypePolicy>
</archetype>
----

There is a special `archetypePolicy` container which is very specific to archetypes.
This container specifies characteristics of _archetyped_ objects, which are objects that have this archetype.
In the case illustrated above, the `Person` archetype is supposed to apply to users who are physical, natural persons (as opposed to virtual _personas_).
Archetype policy specifies that the archetyped objects have _green_ icon defined by `fa fa-user` CSS classes.
Each archetyped object has to be referred to as `Person`.
Plural form `Persons` is going to be used in lists and collections of archetyped objects.
This is quite a minimal definition of archetype.

.Font Awesome icons
TIP: MidPoint is using _Font Awesome_ icons, which is a nice collection of icons to choose from.
Font Awesome icons are referred to by their _CSS classes_.
Readers that have some web design experience would understand.
For the others, just search the web for "font awesome icons", choose an icon and look for snipped of HTML code such as `<i class="fa fa-user"></i>`.
The value of `class` HTML attribute is supposed to go to the `cssClass` property of archetype definition.
Of course, midPoint is open source software, therefore it contains only _free_ Font Awesome icons.

We have nice little archetype definition now.
However, it does not do much just by itself.
Archetype has to be applied to midPoint objects to be useful.
As we are in midPoint, archetypes are _assigned_ to objects, of course.

[source,xml]
----
<user oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000702">
    <name>anderson</name>
    ...
    <assignment>
        <targetRef oid="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000702" type="ArchetypeType"/>
    </assignment>
    ...
</user>
----

When archetype is assigned to an object, the object gains characteristics specified in the _archetype policy_ specified in the archetype.
This means that _persons_ are shown using _green_ color in midPoint user interface, as that is specific in the `Person` archetype.

Archetypes can be managed and create in midPoint user interface as well.
Navigate to menu:Configuration[Archetypes].

Archetypes can specify several aspects that affect look, feel and behavior of archetyped objects:

* Icon, color, labels and similar presentation properties.

* Object template, which specifies mappings and other details about individual data _items_ of the object.

* Provisioning defaults, e.g. specifying that all employees should have an account in enterprise directory.

* Policies to be applied to archetyped objects.

* Collecting the objects, providing ability to quickly look them up in searches, menu shortcuts, and so on.

Archetypes can significantly influence archetyped objects, as you will see in the rest of this chapter.
This ability makes archetypes very useful.
Due to their usefulness, archetypes permeate midPoint configurations.
Many archetypes are provided as pre-configured (initial) objects out-of-the-box.
Archetypes are also seen in prominent places in midPoint user interface.
They also provide prime opportunity for customization.
Overall, archetypes are to the core of every midPoint deployment.

== Structural vs Auxiliary

An object can have more than one archetype, as long as following rules are followed:

* At most one *structural archetype* can be applied to object.
Structural archetype provides _structure_ to the object, it specifies icon, color, and presentation of the object.
In the future, structural archetype may define _schema_ for the objects.

* Any number of *auxiliary archetypes* can be applied to object.
Auxiliary archetypes provide _additional_ information, functionality and policies to the objects.

_Structural_ archetypes should be used to represent _nature_ of the objects, characteristics that are unlikely to change.
Good examples are `Person` or `Application`.
On the other hand, _auxiliary_ archetypes are more like the roles.
They usually represent characteristics that might change, or characteristics that could be combined.
For example, `Employee`, `Student` and `Volunteer` are good examples, as a `Person` could theoretically be student and employee of a school at the same time, as well as volunteer for certain activities.

Definition of _auxiliary_ archetypes is almost the same as definition of _structural_ archetypes, except for `archetypeType` property.

[source,xml]
----
<archetype oid="8070c13e-73ff-11ef-b9ac-7beb1c83f753">
    <name>Employee</name>
    <archetypeType>auxiliary</archetypeType>
</archetype>
----

.Limited UI support
NOTE: User interface support for auxiliary archetypes is quite limited in midPoint 4.8.

// TODO: later: how are structural/auxiliary icons and colors combined?

== Pre-configured Archetypes

Archetypes are very useful mechanism for setting up presentation of behaviour of objects.
Therefore, midPoint contains a set of pre-defined archetypes, ready to be used.
Following table describes the most interesting pre-configured archetypes:

|===
|Archetype |Holder type |Description

|Person
|User
|Archetype for natural persons.

|System user
|User
|Archetype for system users, i.e. non-person users that are needed for system to work, such as `administrator` user.

|Application
|Service
|Archetype for applications, as a basic building blocks for access control.

|Application role
|Role
|Archetype for roles that directly grant access to applications.

|Business role
|Role
|Archetype for roles that represent business concepts.

|System role
|Role
|Archetype for roles that are essential from the system point of view, such as `Superuser` role.

|===

There are other pre-defined archetypes as well, mostly for tasks, cases, reports and marks.
These are not important for now.
There are no pre-defined archetypes for organizational units in midPoint 4.8.
More on that later, in a chapter dedicated to organizational structures.

== Life with Archetypes

Archetypes influence many aspects of "life" for midPoint objects.
Therefore, it is a best practice to set proper archetype for object as soon as the object is created.
This approach makes it easier to customize behavior of objects later on.
For this reason, we have set `Person` archetype for all users created by synchronization from HR system.
This is going to be very useful, as we will see in next chapter dealing with object templates.
Similarly, it is recommended to properly set archetypes for new roles, services, orgs and other objects.

Choosing the right archetypes is quite important, as change of (structural) archetypes is a serious matter.
Archetypes define many aspects of object character, presentation and behavior.
Change of archetype means quite a substantial change of object nature already.
In the future, it is very likely that archetypes could define object _schema_ as well, influencing the way the object is composed and stored.
Therefore, change of archetypes would mean a change of its very structure.
As object schema changes, new mandatory properties would need new values and values of removed properties should be removed.
Therefore, there is already a special method to change an archetype in midPoint.
In midPoint user interface, there is btn:[Change archetype] button on object details page that starts a special action of archetype change.

Archetypes naturally work as _object collections_.
Therefore, archetypes can be used to conveniently search for all archetyped objects.
Simply use the btn:[Object collection] control in the search bar and select archetype you are looking for.
Moreover, archetypes can be used to customize midPoint menu, object details panels and other parts of midPoint user interface.
Menu items regarding archetypes are already pre-configured in some cases (e.g. menu:Administration[Users > Persons]).

.archetypeRef
TIP: Archetypes are _assigned_ to objects.
While archetype assignment is limited, it is still quite a complex object to deal with.
As archetype searches are common, midPoint needs to execute them as quickly as possible.
Therefore, there is special `archetypeRef` reference in archetyped objects, point to applied archetype(s).
However, this reference is _operational_, it is managed by midPoint internally, it should never be changed by midPoint users.
Archetypes should be managed solely by changing _assignments_.
Yet, the `archetypeRef` may still be useful, e.g. when searching for archetyped objects using scripts or midPoint REST interface.

== Meta-roles

// TODO: move section from RBAC chapter here
// TODO: Explain how archetypes act as meta-roles
// TODO: archetypes are meta-roles, that is the reason they are assigned

// TODO: add inducement of `End user` role to `Person` archetype.

== Archetypes and Provisioning

// TODO: default accounts,
// TODO: also slight differences in behavior, e.g. synchronize applications with enterprise application inventory, but not devices, object template, etc.

// TODO: use Person archetype to provision LDAP (need LDAP correlation first!!!)

// TODO: Complete example is at the end of chapter 9.

== Assignment Relation

// TODO: archetypes apply to basic types - assignment relation
// TODO: holder type

// TODO: assignment relation: allow project managers and owners, but not approvers.

== Future of Archetypes

// TODO: schema - not easy to change
// TODO: this is the reason why archetype assignments are limited, we may need flexibility in future
// TODO: archetypes _assigned_ to objects - there are limitations


// TOOD: later: object collections and views
