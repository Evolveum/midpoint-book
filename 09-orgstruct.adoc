= Organizational Structures

[quote, Douglas Adams, "The Restaurant At The End Of The Universe"]
If life is going to exist in a Universe of this size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of proportion.

Organizations come in all shapes and sizes.
Unless your organization is extremely unusual, there is always some form of recognizable internal structure.
There may be the usual corporate divisions, departments and sections.
Or there may be dynamic teams, projects, work groups and task forces.
But some kind of _organizational structure_ is usually there.
And it matters.
While many organizational structures are quite far from the ideal, organizational structure is seldom completely useless.
Membership in some organizational units is a reason to automatically grant privileges.
Managers can usually access quite a wide set of data about employees in organizational units that they are managing.
Team leaders and project manager often exercise elevated privileges over their team and projects.
And all of that is not limited just to users.
Roles are often organized into _role catalog_.
Services and devices may be organized by applications, by geographical location and so on.
There are many things that need to be organized and there are many ways to to organize them.

Organizational structure affects almost every part of the identity management deployment.
We have realized that in very early stages of midPoint development.
Therefore organizational structure is an integral part of midPoint.
It permeates almost every part of midPoint functionality.
Unlike most other systems, organizational structure in midPoint is a very flexible and almost universal concept.
It can be used to build functional organizational structures with divisions, departments and sections.
But it can also be used to create a flat project-based organizational structure.
The same mechanism can be used to sort roles in a role catalog or to manage devices by geographical location.
And all of those organizational structures may co-exist at the same time in the same system.

The concept of organizational structure is a very powerful one, but it is implemented by just a handful of simple components.
Let us have a look at those building blocks now.

== Organizational Units

Basic building blog of all organizational structures is just one simple object type.
Due to the lack of poetic talent and because of critical shortage of abstract words in our dictionary, we have decided to call that object simply an _org_.
It is a nice and short name.
_Org_ can represent any kind of organizational unit: companies, division, department, section, project, team, role category, geographical location or anything else.
Orgs can be used to create hierarchical structures.
For example, a top-level org may represent a company. A couple of other orgs can represent divisions.
Those orgs can be put "inside" the company org.
Yet another orgs can represent divisions and they can be put "inside" the division orgs.
Repeat the process until complete organizational structure is formed.

.Organizational tree
image::09-01-org-tree.png[Organizational tree]

Org is quite a basic thing with a very simple anatomy:

.org-example-top.xml
[source,xml]
----
<org oid="4d12c1ac-440c-11ea-80af-2b314d06ba95">
    <name>F10000</name>
    <displayName>ExAmPLE, Inc.</displayName>
</org>
----

Strictly speaking, the only things that an org really needs are name and OID.
The example above adds `displayName` to make the presentation of the org nicer.
As all regular midPoint objects, a name of an org must be unique.
This often leads to a practice that org names are in fact identifiers or that they are generated automatically.
This is also our case.
We have decided to set `F1000` as the name of this org.
The value `1000` is an identifier of the company in our HR system.
As we are building a functional organizational structure of the company, we have prefixed the identifier with `F` which stands for _functional_.
However, names such as `F1000` are not very friendly.
Therefore there is a mechanism to set nicer display name that does not need to be unique.
The display name will be used instead of the ordinary `name` whenever this org is displayed to a user.

.Top-level organizational unit
image::09-02-org-top.png[Top-level organizational unit]

We have an organizational unit now.
But how do we put users in it?
Clever reader already knows the answer: assignment.
All that is needed is to assign the org to a user.
This is done in almost the same way as you would assign a role, just select the `Org` tab in assignment dialog.

.Assignment of an organizational unit
image::09-03-top-org-assignment.png[Assignment of an organizational unit]

Or, in XML form:

[source,xml]
----
<user>
    <name>eevans</name>
    ...
    <assignment>
        <targetRef oid="4d12c1ac-440c-11ea-80af-2b314d06ba95" type="OrgType"/>
    </assignment>
    ...
</user>
----


The user is a part of our minimalistic organizational unit now:

.Assigned top-level organizational unit
image::09-04-top-org-assignment-tree.png[Assigned top-level organizational unit]

== Organizational Structure Hierarchy

There is very little structure in our tiny organizational structure yet.
Orgs would not be very useful unless they can be placed inside each other, creating a hierarchy.
It is this hierarchy that makes organizational structures attractive.
Therefore let us go corporate and create some hierarchy now.
It is a well-known fact that all self-respecting corporations need sales and marketing division:

.org-sales-and-marketing-division.xml
[source,xml]
----
<org oid="7a1feb50-471f-11ea-8aab-1b2627541f15">
    <name>F11000</name>
    <description>Expensive people that make money.</description>
    <displayName>Sales and Marketing Division</displayName>
    <identifier>11000</identifier>
</org>
----

We have pimped up this organizational unit a little.
We have seen `name` and `displayName` before.
The `description` is no strange either.
But there is also an `identifier`.
The value of the `identifier` is usually an official "code" of the organizational unit assigned by HR people.
But why do we need yet another identifier?
OID is an identifier, `name` is an identifier of sorts, why do we need another one?
For now let's just say that the identifier will be very useful later on, when we will be synchronizing organizational structures.

If we import the org above into midPoint it will become the _top_ org.
MidPoint will put it at the same level as the ExAmPLE company org.
But we do not want that.
We want to create a hierarchy.
We want to tell midPoint to put the department inside the company.
How do we do that?
We use an assignment, of course:

.org-sales-and-marketing-division.xml
[source,xml]
----
<org oid="7a1feb50-471f-11ea-8aab-1b2627541f15"
    xmlns='http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3'
       xmlns:org='http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/org-3'>
    <name>F11000</name>
    <description>Expensive people that make money.</description>
    <displayName>Sales and Marketing Division</displayName>
    <identifier>11000</identifier>
    <assignment>
       <targetRef oid="4d12c1ac-440c-11ea-80af-2b314d06ba95" type="OrgType"/>
    </assignment>
</org>
----

Now we have our little hierarchy:

.Small organizational structure tree
image::09-05-small-org-tree.png[Small organizational structure tree]

This makes perfect sense, doesn't it?
User become part of organizational units when the units are assigned to them.
Therefore also organizational units become part of other organizational units when they are assigned to them.
And this applies to everything: roles, services, tasks, resources and other object types.
Every object type that can be _assignment holder_ can be placed in organizational structure.

.Assignment holders
NOTE: Majority of midPoint object types are _assginment holders_ and therefore they can be placed into organizational structure.
Theoretically.
However, midPoint user interface has some limits.
Convenient management of the assignments is currently possible only for _focal_ types: user, role, org and service.
Other objects can be placed in organizational structure and they should behave up to the expectations.
But that cannot be done by few convenient clicks in midPoint user interface
Not yet.
You have to use a different approach.
You either add the assignment manually in the XML/JSON/YAML form.
Or you may try to use mappings to create the assignments automatically.
Or perhaps use the REST interface to do that.
Or maybe send some money in the direction of midPoint development team to motivate them to add this functionality to user interface.

We know how to create a simple organizational hierarchy.
All we need to do now is to repeat the process _ad nauseam_ to create something that resembles real corporate organizational structure.
Let us add marketing department to our division:

.org-marketing-department.xml
[source,xml]
----
<org oid="a0c7d92c-4722-11ea-bc8d-d79a6cefb1bf"
    xmlns='http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/common-3'
       xmlns:org='http://midpoint.evolveum.com/xml/ns/public/common/org-3'>
    <name>F11300</name>
    <description>Creative bunch that spends money to get more money.</description>
    <displayName>Marketing Department</displayName>
    <identifier>11300</identifier>
    <assignment>
       <targetRef oid="7a1feb50-471f-11ea-8aab-1b2627541f15" type="OrgType"/>
    </assignment>
</org>
----

It is the same process over and over again.
But there so many organizational units, there are so many files to import.
We like to be efficient in all the things that we do.
Therefore let's put the entire organizational structure into a single file:

.org-tree-functional.xml
[source,xml]
----
<objects>

    <!-- Functional organizational structure of ExAmPLE company -->

    <org oid="4d12c1ac-440c-11ea-80af-2b314d06ba95">
        <name>F10000</name>
        <displayName>ExAmPLE, Inc.</displayName>
    </org>

    <org oid="7a1feb50-471f-11ea-8aab-1b2627541f15">
        <name>F11000</name>
        <description>Expensive people that make money.</description>
        <displayName>Sales and Marketing Division</displayName>
        <identifier>11000</identifier>
        <assignment>
            <targetRef oid="4d12c1ac-440c-11ea-80af-2b314d06ba95" type="OrgType"/>
        </assignment>
    </org>

    ...

</objects>
----

It would be no big surprise to find out that laziness was a driving force behind many improvements in life, would it?
Now, let us use this convenient approach to create a nice and rich corporate organizational tree:

.Organizational tree
image::09-06-org-tree-page.png[Organizational tree]

TIP: Of course, you can create and manage organizational structure in midPoint user interface.
In fact, people do that quite often.
But now we are talking about the _initial_ organizational structure.
It is the structure that gets created in midPoint at the beginning of the deployment.
There is usually a lot of _trial and error_ until you get your midPoint configuration right.
It is quite likely you will have to purge all midPoint configuration and start clean.
In that case, it is very convenient to have organizational structure in one file that can be easily imported after the clean up.
Also, it is a common practice to have several environments: development, testing and production.
You probably want the same organizational structure in all of them.
Having organizational structure in a file makes that job easy.
Of course, you can also create organizational structure in the user interface and then export it into a file.
But according to our experience, many engineers prefer text editor to graphical user interfaces.

== Orgs in the Database

Organizational structures tend to form _hierarchies_ - data structures that look like trees.
But databases are usually designed to store _relational_ data - data structures that look like tables.
If you ever tried to express hierarchical data in a spreadsheet application you know that these paradigms are not entirely easy to align.
It is not entirely easy to express tree-like data structure in relational tables.
Moreover, hierarchical data tend to have some specific requirements.
For example, we usually want to look for people in _Operations Division_ and all the departments and sections that belong to it.
This is know as _subtree searches_, and it is usually not possible to execute them directly on data that are stored in relational form.

This is further complicated by the fact that midPoint _assignment_ is a very flexible data structure.
Assignments can be valid from a specific time to a specific time.
Assignments can be parametric and conditional.
Assignment is just too complex for the database to understand and use efficiently.

MidPoint is solving these problems with `parentOrgRef` operational data item.
As the name suggests, `parentOrgRef` is an object reference that points to _parent org_.
Any _assignment holder_ in midPoint can have _parentOrgRef_ and it points to the org (or orgs) that the object belongs to.
This somehow duplicated the data in the assignment.
But there are several crucial differences.

Firstly, `parentOrgRef` points to the orgs that the object is _currently_ member of.
I.e. it only reflects those assignments that are currently active and valid.
Therefore there will be no `parentOrgRef` value for assignment that is expired or not valid yet.

Secondly, `parentOrgRef` represents all organizational assignments, both direct and indirect.
Orgs that are directly assigned to users will be present in `parentOrgRef`.
Orgs that are induced in a role that is assigned to the user will also be present in `parentOrgRef`.
Everything will be there.

Thirdly, `parentOrgRef` is a very simple data structure.
This simplicity allows efficient _indexing_ of the `parentOrgRef` values in the database (repository) layer.
The indexes are designed to allow efficient subtree searches over organizational structure hierarchies.

This is our trick how to fit hierarchical data into flat data tables.
The details may be quite complicated, but it usually works quite well.
The `parentOrgRef` is automatically maintained by midPoint under the hood.
Therefore it is usually completely transparent.
The user does not even notice that there is a special mechanism working in the background.

However, there are also downsides to this approach.
The index that is build on `parentOrgRef` is designed to work even if organizational structure is re-organized.
The index has to be continually maintained.
Maintenance overhead of the index is usually very low for small or mid-sized structures that do not change often.
But maintenance of massive organizational structures can be painful.
Similarly, it may be problematic to maintain organizational structures that change very frequently.
Therefore it is perhaps a good idea to prototype the design of organizational structure before putting the system into production.
Also, the `parentOrgRef` is in fact a copy of the primary data (assignment).
As it is a copy, there is a risk that it may get out of synchronization.
MidPoint is designed to keep `parentOrgRef` and all the indexes strictly consistent during normal operations.
However, midPoint allows systems administrators to do a lot of non-standard things.
Some of those things may lead to data inconsistencies.
Therefore it is a good idea to check whether the values of `parentOrgRef` make sense in case you notice that organizational structures are behaving strangely.

Overall, organizational structures work very well in midPoint and you usually do not need to care about the mechanisms under the hood.
However, management of organizational structures is much more complex than it seems.
Therefore if you try to do strange and unusual things, you should better be sure you fully understand what you are doing.

== Orgs and Roles

Organizations and roles have many things in common.
Roles are granting privileges to its members.
Usually, people that are members of an organization are granted privileges too.
People that have the same role usually have the same set of privileges.
People in an organization often have the same privileges too.
In fact, organizations behave in almost the same way as roles.

MidPoint has fully embraced this similarity.
Orgs are designed to behave in almost the same way as roles.
Orgs may have _inducements_, there may be _constructions_ in them, orgs may contain _authorizations_ and so on.
Org can do everything that a role can do.

Therefore there is no need to set up complicated configurations that assign a particular role to all members of an organization.
The organization itself acts as a role.
All the privileges that organization members need can be simply added as _inducements_ in the organization itself.
This is very simple, elegant and mostly fool-proof solution.

We have _Indirect Sales Department_ in ExAmPLE, Inc.
We want to make things simple, and therefore we want to grant access to CRM system to all the members of this department.
It is very easy to do:

[source,xml]
----
<org oid="8887e0b0-4726-11ea-96b0-5f5ced221e42">
    <name>F11200</name>
    <description>Suits that talk to other suits that talk to customers.</description>
    <displayName>Indirect Sales Department</displayName>
    <identifier>11200</identifier>
    <assignment>
        <!-- Assignment of parent organizational unit -->
        <targetRef oid="7a1feb50-471f-11ea-8aab-1b2627541f15" type="OrgType"/>
    </assignment>
    <inducement>
        <!-- Inducement that grants CRM privileges to all members of this department -->
        <construction>
            <!-- CRM resource -->
            <resourceRef oid="04afeda6-394b-11e6-8cbe-abf7ff430056"/>
            ...
        </construction>
    </inducement>
</org>
----

Clever reader certainly wonders whether the CRM privileges apply also to _Agent Management Section_, which is located below _Indirect Sales Department_ in our organizational structure.
However, clever reader is clever enough to figure out that the privileges are not "inherited" in this case.
To follow the toughts of clever reader, you have to think about orgs in the same way as you would think about roles.
There is an assignment from _Agent Management Section_ to _Indirect Sales Department_.
But there is no _inducement_.
Role hierarchies are built using _inducements_.
Therefore privileges of _Agent Management Section_ are not included in _Indirect Sales Department_.
This may seem to be counter-intuitive, but in fact it is completely correct.
Orgs and roles form separate hierarchies (see note below).
However, if you want to "inherit" privileges of a parent org, there is a very simple way how to do it: add explicit _inducement_.
For example, this is how we can "inherit" the CRM privileges in _Agent Management Section_:

[source,xml]
----
<org oid="f5e619a6-4726-11ea-888c-ab25c098d8b3">
    <name>F11210</name>
    <description>People that deal with agents (no James Bond here).</description>
    <displayName>Agent Management Section</displayName>
    <identifier>11210</identifier>
    <assignment>
        <!-- Assignment of parent organizational unit. This creates organizational hierarchy. -->
        <targetRef oid="8887e0b0-4726-11ea-96b0-5f5ced221e42" type="OrgType"/>
    </assignment>
    <inducement>
        <!-- Inducement to parent organizational unit. This creates "inheritance" of privileges. -->
        <targetRef oid="8887e0b0-4726-11ea-96b0-5f5ced221e42" type="OrgType"/>
    </assignment>
</org>
----

This has to be done for every org that needs to inherit privileges from parent, which may be quite daunting for large organizational structures.
There is a clever way how to avoid placing inducements everywhere.
The solution involves the concept of _metaroles_, as parent org is technically a metarole for child orgs.
However, this involves an advanced thinking about application of assignment and inducements.
Even a clever reader may not be ready for such abstract thoughts yet.
This has to come later when the basic principles have enough time to sink in.

.Org and role hierarchies
NOTE: Both orgs are roles are _hierarchical_ in a way.
BUt it is not the same hierarchy.
Org hierarchy is used to model organizational trees.
Role hierarchy is used to build RBAC structures.
Those hierarchies have completely different purpose.
They are also built using different mechanism.
Role hierarchy is used to group privileges and therefore it is built using _inducements_.
Org hierarchy is used to group subjects (users) and it is built using _assignments_.
There are also different internal mechanisms, indexing and data storage properties.
For example, role hierarchy is not using `parentOrgRef`, therefore there is much lower overhead as compared to org hierarchy.
However, this means that the capabilities to query role hierarchy is limited.
Both hierarchies are their respective place and purpose.
Even though the difference may not be very apparent now, it is quite substantial.
Hopefully, this will get much more clear later when there will be more examples for both org and role structures.

== Managers

Placing people in organizational structures has a significant value on its own.
However, all the people usually do not have the same _relation_ to the organizational unit.
Most people will usually be ordinary _members_ of organizational unit.
And then there are people that are somehow special: departmental managers, team leaders, project managers, supervisors and similar life forms.

How do we designate a manager of an organizational unit?
You probably guessed it already.
In a typical midPoint fashion, we are re-using _assignment_, of course.
There is just one small detail.
We are specifying `relation` in assignment target reference:

[source,xml]
----
<user>
    <name>aanderson</name>
    ...
    <assignment>
        <!-- Direct Sales Department -->
        <targetRef oid="832f409a-4726-11ea-b0be-8b8eab99c1ed" type="OrgType" relation="manager"/>
    </assignment>
    ...
</user>
----

This assignment makes Alice a manager of direct sales department.
It is as simple as that.
And all the power of assignment is at your disposal.
Therefore it is easy to assign a manager for a temporary time period, suspend a manager and so on.

Manager assignment is created in the user interface in almost the same way as normal assignment is created.
The only difference is selection of _manager relation_ at the bottom of the assignment target dialog:

.Assign organizational unit manager
image::09-07-assign-org-manager.png[Assign organizational unit manager]

MidPoint now knows that Alice is a manager of Direct Sales Department.
This is also displayed in the organizational tree:

.Organizational unit with a manager
image::09-08-org-tree-manager.png[Organizational unit with a manager]

But, wait a minute!
Alice has been promoted to be a _manager_ of direct sales department.
But she should be located in sales and marketing division as a direct _member_ of that division.
E.i. she is _member_ of one organizational unit and _manager_ of another organizational unit.
How do we do that?
This is all perfectly clear to a clever reader by now.
Alice has assignments.
First assignment is an ordinary assignment that targets sales and marketing division.
Second assignment is a manager assignment that targets direct sales department.
This is perfectly normal in midPoint.
Users may have any number of assignments to any objects (unless it is explicitly constrained by policy rules or archetypes).
Which means that users may be members of any number of organizational units at the same time.

Therefore there is no problem for Alice to be a member of one unit and manager of another.
MidPoint can support all kind of bizarre organizational arrangements.
MidPoint was deliberately designed in this way.
Because reality has an annoying habit to bring surprises, especially when organizational structures are involved.

Well, Alice is a manager now.
Good for her.
But she still has the same access rights as ordinary workers.
That is not right!
Managers wear suits and ties.
Which means that they need to have more privileges than mere mortals.
As managers usually control funding of software development, it is perfectly understandable that midPoint has a way to set up privileges that apply to managers:

[source,xml]
----
<org oid="832f409a-4726-11ea-b0be-8b8eab99c1ed">
    <name>F11100</name>
    <displayName>Direct Sales Department</displayName>
    ...
    <inducement>
        <construction>
            ... Privileges exclusive to managers are specified here ...
        </construction>
        <orderConstraint>
            <order>1</order>
            <relation>manager</relation>
        </orderConstraint>
    </inducement>
</org>
----

This is a way how a manager of the direct sales department gets special privileges.
The `orderConstraint` makes sure that only the users that have `manager` relation to this organization units will get the privileges.

But wait s minute!
Clever reader does not like that.
This approach to manager privileges is not going to be very practical.
Managers usually do not have special privileges in each organizational unit.
In most organizations, managers have the same privileges regardless of the unit they manage.

One way to implement this approach is to create a `Manager` role, put the special privileges there, and assign the role to every manager of every organizational unit.
But that creates redundancy.
We have to make sure this role is assigned whenever a person becomes manager and that it is unassigned when the person is no longer manager.
This is the way how this problem is solved in many IDM deployments.
But it is quite a fragile mechanism.
And this is not a way how we do things in midPoint.

The `orderConstraint` data structure in our example looks suspiciously complex.
And it indeed is quite a complex concept.
What we see here is the first glimpse at high-order "assignment algebra" that is a working horse of complex midPoint deployment.
It is often employed when working with meta-roles and archetypes.
As organizational units are in fact roles and organizational structures are just a trees formed by _assignments_, they technically form meta-role structures.

Therefore the right way how to set up manager privileges is to move privilege definition to a central place.
It may be top-level organizational unit, or it may be an _archetype_.
In that case our _inducement_ can apply to all the managers, regardless of organizational unit.
However, the exact configuration is a bit complex, and we still need to learn more about midPoint to be able to use it.
Therefore we leave the details for later chapters.

TIP: MidPoint assigns managers to organizational units.
That is the right way how to do it.
However, we have often seen a different approach.
In such cases the manager is "assigned" to users.
I.e. each user has a reference to his or her manager.
This approach is wrong.
Organizational structures change.
People come and go.
Everything is changing all the time.
It is very easy to change one assignment in organizational structure in case that a manager is replaced.
But it is extremely difficult to replace a manager in the direct user-manager data structure.
Maybe the former manager was managing several organizational units and now we are replacing him with two managers.
Maybe there is a re-organization going on at the same time.
The result is going to be a mess.
Avoid the direct user-manager approach whenever possible.

== Relation

In midPoint, we like to design generic re-usable mechanisms.
You did not think that we made the concept of _manager_ in a way that would be hardcoded to organizational structure, did you?
As you have got so far through this book, you would probably suspect there is more to this _relation_ thing that we have seen so far.

The _relation_ specifies the nature of a relation between two objects.
For example a user may be a member of an organizational unit, manager of a project, owner of a role or approver of role assignment requests.
In such cases, _member_, _manager_, _owner_ and _approver_ are relations that a user can have to an object.

The most common way how to use relation is to specify it in `targetRef` in an assignment.
The following example illustrates the usual way how to assign an owner for a role:

[source,xml]
----
<user>
    <name>aanderson</name>
    ...
    <assignment>
        <!-- Business Analyst role -->
        <targetRef oid="aaa6cde4-0471-11e9-9b50-c743da469067" type="RoleType" relation="owner"/>
    </assignment>
    ...
</user>
----

There are several built-in relations in midPoint:

|===
|Relation |Usually used for |Description

|`default`
| Everything
| This is the most common, non-specific relation to an object.
When used with a role, it simply means that the user _has_ the role.
Usually interpreted as _member_ when used with organizational units.
It is the usual, normal relation.

As the name suggests, this is the default relation.
If no other relation is specified, this relation is used.

|`manager`
|Orgs
|Manager of an organizational unit, project manager, teamleader, etc.
Usually entitles a person (or a group) that have leading position in an org.
This usually specifies executive or operational privileges (cf. `owner`).

|`owner`
|Roles, Orgs
|Person responsible for governance of the object.
Often used to nominate role owners that are responsible for role definition and maintenance.
May be used with organizational units to specify project sponsor or business owner.
Specifies a person responsible for governance and high-level policy decisions rather than day-to-day management (cf. `manager`).

|`approver`
|Roles, Orgs
|Person responsible for deciding _membership_ in roles and orgs.
A gatekeeper or moderator.
Approvers usually decide whether someone can have a role, or may be a member of organizational unit.
Unlike owners, approvers do not create or modify role definition.
They cannot change the role.
They can only decide who can have that role and who cannot.

|`meta`
|Metaroles
|Special-purpose relation that is sometimes used with metaroles.
Metarole structures can be complex and confusing.
However, such structures and especially policies that govern them may sometimes be simplified, if role-metarole relations are marked in a special way.
This relation is designed specifically for that purpose.

The `meta` relation is not mandatory.
Metarole functionality will work just fine without it.
In fact, almost all of the metarole configuration are not using this relation.
But it may come handy if the situation becomes too complicated.
|===

Those are built-in relations.
There are some pre-configured policies that work with them.
However, you are free to specify and use your own relations.
But that is quite an advanced topic and majority of the deployments are perfectly fine using just the built-in relations.

As you can see, the built-in relations do not have overly strict specifications.
There is a lot of _usually_, _often_ and _almost_ in the description of relations.
The reason is that the relations do not do anything just by themselves.
They just specify how one object relates to another object.
There are no strict _policies_ or _behavior_ associated with them.

The policies are specified elsewhere.
Assignment and inducements may behave differently for different relations, as we have seen in previous section.
Similarly, _policy rules_ are often sensitive to relations.
For example the policy that assignment of some roles has to be approved is implemented by a policy rule that is aware of `approver` relation.
Authorizations are often sensitive to relations.
Archetypes influence how the system behaves based on relations.
User interface may behave differently for some relations.
And so on.
Relations do nothing just by themselves.
However, good part of the system is usually configured to recognize relations and behave accordingly.
It is a matter of that _configuration_ that determines how exactly will the system behave.
This is also the reason for such vague definition of relations, even those built-in relations.
They will do what you make them do.

== Multiple Organizational Structures

Tree is a simple and very elegant structure in many ways.
But it is a rare sight to see a lone tree growing in the field.
When we think of trees, we usually think about a forrest.
It takes a lot of trees to make a forrest.

This is also the case when it comes to organizational structures.
It is a very rare sight when an entire organizational structure of an organization can be modeled in a single tree.
There is always the usual _functional_ organizational structure with divisions, departments, sections, companies, branches, schools and faculties.
But then there is a _project_ organizational structure that is often completely orthogonal to functional organizational structure.
This is sometimes spiced up with workgroups, task forces, focus groups, research teams, interest groups, clubs and similar collective life forms.
There are the many trees that make a forrest.

Fortunately, midPoint is not very picky when it comes to organizational structures.
You can have as many organizational trees as you like.
MidPoint is not limited to a single organizational tree.
You can have functional organizational tree, as we have seen in previous sections.
Then you can have independent project organizational structure.
Just create new root _org_ for projects and place the projects under it:

.org-tree-project.xml
[source,xml]

<org oid="832e37e4-edfd-11ea-9f8c-ef736d6646a2">

    </assignment>
</org>
----

We have two organizational trees now.
Each neatly stowed under its own tab:

.Project organizational tree
image::09-09-org-tree-projects.png[Project organizational tree]

This is a nice _project_ organizational structure.
But our users are members of _functional_ organizational structure already.
How can I add my users to the projects?
The answer is _assignment_, of course.
User can belong to any number of organizational units at the same time.
It makes no difference whether they are in the same organizational tree or in different trees.
Simply assign the projects to the users.
The same _manager_ relation works for projects as well.
In fact, midPoint does not even recognize the difference between _functional_ and _project_ organizational structures.
They look all the same to midPoint and midPoint treats them in the same way.
If there is a need for the structures to behave differently, it has to be explicitly configured.
Which is usually done by using _archetypes_.
We will talk about _archetypes_ later.

There are two organizational structures now.
You can have three organizational structures if you want to.
Of five of them.
Any number you like - as long as all the tabs for organizational structures fit on the screen.
The structures can be deep and trees with many branches.
Or they can be completely flat.
The structure may not even be a tree.
As long as it is an _acyclic directed graph_ it will work just fine.
It can have multiple roots, it may have alternate paths, it can do all the crazy stuff.
Just avoid cycles.
Cycles break the maths which is the foundation of organizational structure indexing and evaluation.
Cycles won't work.
But pretty much all the other arrangements are perfectly fine.

Organizational structure may have almost any form.
A user can be a member of many organizational units.
Which also means that a user may _manage_ many organizational units.
That also applies the other way around: an organizational unit may have many managers.
MidPoint fully supports all such cases.
By default, MidPoint is very flexible when it deals with organizational structure.
However, you may not like all this liberalism in organizational management.
_Ordnung muss sien!_
If you want to constraint organizational management to allow only a single manager for each organizational unit, you can do it.
But you have to explicitly specify a policy by setting up _policy rules_.
_Policy rules_ provide a very generic and very powerful mechanism how to constraint and control midPoint in many ways.
But that is a topic for its own chapter.

== Beyond Users

MidPoint organizational structure can do a lot of crazy stuff.
Organizational structures are usually build to contain people.
Whereas midPoint organizational structure can contain a broad range of object types.
Users, roles and services are the most common object types, but almost any other midPoint object can be placed in organizational structure.

_Role catalog_ is a common use of organizational structure that does not (directly) involve people.
Role catalog is used to sort the roles into categories, much like a catalog in electronic shop is used to sort the products.
The catalog is used to present roles to users in organized form, so users may easily find the roles when request them in self-service interface.

MidPoint role catalog is simply an organizational structure.
It does not have divisions, sections or projects, but it has categories.
Categories are (almost) ordinary orgs that form the hierarchy.

.Role catalog
image::09-10-role-catalog.png[Role catalog]

Primary use of the catalog is related to request-and-approval process.
The catalog makes it easier for a user to find appropriate role when requesting its assignment in self-service part of midPoint user interface.
However, the catalog can also be used to apply policies to a whole group of roles.
Owner of the category may be considered to be a default approver for all the roles in the category.
Category owner may be authorized to modify roles in the category.
And so on.

Similar approach can be applied to most objects in midPoint.
Organizational structure can be used to organize roles, services, resources, function libraries and other objects.
Orgs are also crucial mechanism in supporting midPoint multi-tenancy.
Not everything is perfectly supported in user interface yet.
Yet, the organizational structure is a powerful mechanism to systematically and consistently apply policies and organize the system.

== Organizational Structure Synchronization

MidPoint can manage organizational structure.
But where that structure comes from?
Back in 20^th^ century there were entire teams dedicated to drawing organizational chart on paper.
It is 21^st^ century now, we do not use paper any more.
We are using computers to manage organizational charts now.
Which means that dedicated teams are drawing organizational charts in Excel and distributing them by e-mail.

Fortunately, there are some organizations that have truly progressed into 21^st^ century.
Such organizations store their organizational structures in a structured form, usually in database tables.
When exported to a CSV file, the structure may look like this:

.org.csv
[source,csv]
----
"orgnum","name","description","parentOrgNum"
"10000","ExAmPLE","ExAmPLE, Inc.",""
"11000","Sales and Marketing Division","Expensive people that make money.","10000"
"11100","Direct Sales Department","Suits that talk to customers directly.","11000"
"11200","Indirect Sales Department","Suits that talk to other suits that talk to customers.","11000"
...
----

In this case each organizational unit has a unique identifier, such as `11000`.
Each organizational unit has a reference to parent organizational unit.
When all the lines are processed, they form a complete organizational tree.

This is a very good information source.
Of course, we would like to automatically pull the data from this source instead of managing organization tree manually.
How could we do it?
Clever reader is smiling, remembering that we like to create generic re-usable mechanisms in midPoint.
There is a way how to synchronize _user_ records from the HR system.
Of course, the same mechanisms can be reused to synchronize _organizational unit_ records.

MidPoint synchronization mechanism can work with almost any object.
It can synchronize HR records to users, organizational unit records to orgs, printer database to services, Active directory groups to roles or pretty much anything to anything.
This is what we call _generic synchronization_.

Similarly to ordinary synchronization, we need to start with a _resource_.
However, this resource will not contain accounts, it will contain organizational units.

</resource>
----

This should all look very familiar by now.
It is almost the same resource as we have seen in the synchronization chapter.
However, there are few differences.
We will describe them in next sections.

=== Kind and Intent

The definition of "Organizational unit" resource object contains specification of _kind_ and _intent_:

.resource-csv-org.xml
[source,xml]
----
        ...
        <objectType>
            <displayName>Organizational unit</displayName>
            <default>true</default>
            <objectClass>ri:AccountObjectClass</objectClass>
            <kind>generic</kind>
            <intent>orgunit</intent>
            ...
----

Kind and intent identify the type of resource object for use by midPoint.
There are three possible values for _kind_:

|===
| Kind | Description

| `account`
| Resource object that represents identity of a person, either physical such as computer user or virtual such as `administrator`, `root`, `daemon` or similar special-purpose identities.
Accounts are usually linked to the User objects.


| `entitlement`
| Resource object that represents groupings or privileges of an account.
Entitlement resource objects represent groups, resource-specific roles or access permissions.
Entitlements are meant to be associated to an account.
For example a `group` entitlement may have accounts as its members.


| `generic`
| Any other type of resource object.
This is used for resource objects that cannot be classified as _account_ or _entitlement_.
|===

You can choose any of these accounts for your resource objects.
Values of _kind_ are pre-defined in midPoint, as midPoint will make some assumptions about them.
For example, midPoint will expect that accounts can be associated with entitlements, for example accounts may be members of groups.
Therefore, it is recommended to properly categorize your resource objects to kinds.
This also helps to make the configuration understandable for mere mortals.

Then there is _intent_. There are no pre-defined values for _intent_ in midPoint, perhaps except for value `default` that will be used in case there is no explicit definition of _intent_.
You can choose any value that you like.
However, it is recommended to choose a value that describes the intended use of the resource object.
For example:

|===
| Kind | Example intent | Description

| `account`
| `default`
| Default account.
This usually means the usual, very ordinary user account.

| `account`
| `admin`
| Administration account.
Used in situations where administrators get dedicated accounts with administrator privileges.

| `account`
| `test`
| Testing account.
Used when testers are given special-purpose accounts to use for testing, to avoid interference with their usual accounts.


| `entitlement`
| `group`
| The usual, most ordinary, boring group of users.
It can have accounts or other groups as its members.

| `entitlement`
| `posixGroup`
| LDAP `posixGroup`, used to assign UNIX group membership in LDAP.
It has a different structure than ordinary group, hence we would like to use a different _kind_ for it.


| `entitlement`
| `privilege`
| Resource object that represents system privilege.
Can be "given" to an account.


| `generic`
| `locality`
| Resource object that represents physical location in our organization.
Such as branch office, campus building or meeting room.
It has no formal association to the account.

| `generic`
| `orgunit`
| Resource object that represents organizational unit.
In our case, it represents one record in the organizational chart database.

|===

These are just examples.
You can choose any kind/intent combination that makes sense for your deployment.
For example, you may choose to use `entitlement` kind for organizational units instead of `generic`.
MidPoint would work fine even in that case.
However, our `Organizational Chart` resource does not have any accounts, therefore the organizational units cannot realy be associated to anything in this resource.
Also, membership in an organizational unit does not really look like an entitlement.
Therefore we have chosen to use `generic` kind here.
You are free to make your own choices.

.Why `AccountObjectClass`?
NOTE: Why is there `AccountObjectClass` in the configuration?
We are not working with accounts here, we work with organizational units.
So, why `AccountObjectClass`?
The reason is the CSV connector that we are using.
The CSV connector is quite simplistic, it considers everything to be an account.
Object classes are set by the connector, hence we need to use `AccountObjectClass` here.
However, the _kind_ and _intent_ definition is "overriding" the notion that this is an account, making it more understandable for the users.

_Kind_ and _intent_ behave like coordinates when midPoint has to identify resource object that is assigned to a user.
A user may have at most one _default account_ on a resource (which means kind=`account`, intent=`default`).
That same user may also have _admin account_ on the same resource (kind=`account`, intent=`admin`).
A role may be represented by at most one _LDAP group_ on a resource (kind=`entitlement`, intent=`ldapGroup`).
This is heavily used by midPoint logic.
Whenever there are two _constructions_ that have the same combination of kind+intent, midPoint assumes that they are describing the same resource object.
MidPoint automatically merges the constructions.
If the constructions have different combination of kind+intent, midPoint assumes that they are describing different resource objects and the constructions are processed separately.
Correct configuration of _kind_ and _intent_ is crucial for midPoint to work correctly.

.Tag (a.k.a. "multiaccounts")
TIP: The requirement that there may be at most one resource object for each kind+intent combination works very well in most cases.
However, there are also cases when more that one resource object is needed.
_Kind_ and _intent_ has to be specified in the configuration, therefore this mechanism will not work for resource objects that appear and disappear dynamically.
Therefore, new concept of _tag_ was introduced in midPoint 4.0.
The _tag_ can supplement the kind+intent combination with a dynamic value, thus allowing multiple resource objects to exist for any particular kind+intent combination.
This feature is colloquially known as "multiaccounts".

=== Names and Identifiers

Synchronization of organizational structure is the same as synchronization of users.
Theoretically.
However, there are some subtle differences in practice, mostly caused by the differences of `User` and `Org` schemas.

The first difference originates from the fact, that `name` of the org has to be unique.
This uniqueness is usually not a problem for users, as username is naturally unique among the entire user base.
However, this is slightly different for orgs, as there may be several parallel organizational structures.
There may be `Security` department, `Security` project and `Security` workgroup at the same time.
This may be partially solved by using identifiers instead of names.
However, this still does not solve the problem of department `123` and project `123`.
The simple solution is to prefix the identifier with a code of the organizational tree that it belongs to, thus creating department `O123` and project `P123`.
However, users looking for project `123` may have difficulty finding it, as the `P` prefix in `P123` name is usually just a deliberate decision of IDM administrator.
Therefore, we still want to store the original identifier value (`123`) into the `identifier` property of the org object.
There is no uniqueness constrain on the `identifier` property, therefore both department `123` and project `123` can co-exist and both can be easily discovered by searching the identifier.
The result is that we neet two inbound mappings for the `` attribute:

.resource-csv-org.xml
[source,xml]
----
            <attribute>
                <ref>ri:orgnum</ref>
                <inbound>
                    <target>
                        <path>$focus/identifier</path>
                    </target>
                </inbound>
                <inbound>
                    <expression>
                        <script>
                            <code>'O'+input</code>
                        </script>
                    </expression>
                    <target>
                        <path>$focus/name</path>
                    </target>
                </inbound>
            </attribute>
----

Storing original organizational unit identifier in the `identifier` property makes it easier to correlate organizational units.
The `idenfier` property can be used in the correlation query.
If the identifier is reasonably persistent, this is a huge benefit.

Changes in organizational structure can be quite nasty.
Organizational units are often renamed or moved in organizational trees.
Simplistic synchronization configuration may not be able to interpret such events correctly.
It may look like new organizational unit was created, and the old unit was deleted.
This is likely to wreak havoc to organizational unit assignments, especially if there were special privileges configured for this organizational unit.
Even worse, organizational tree data are sometimes acquired from a different source than the user data, which is causing timing problems.
If organizational tree is updated first, there will be new empty organizational unit, old unit will be deleted, and user assignments will become invalid.
If user data are updated first, the synchronization routines may not be able to update the assignments as the new organizational unit does not exist yet.
This is going to cause a whole lot of problems, most of them will need to be fixed by manual intervention of IDM administrator.
Additionally, reorganizations usually happen in cycles, each cycle changing a number of units at the same time.
Which means that every few months the organizational structure is going to break down, everybody will be complaining, and it will take days to fix all the problems manually.

All of that can be avoided if there are reasonably persistent organizational unit identifiers.
Which means that every organizational unit has an identifier that does not change when the unit is renamed or moved.
In that case midPoint can reliably detect the rename, change organizational unit name and keep the assignments intact.
MidPoint can also detect that the unit was moves, change the parent unit and still keep all the assignments.
Organizational unit identifiers make everything so much easier.
Therefore, try really hard to use the identifier when setting up synchronization of organizational structure.
If there is no such identifier, talk to the business people to add it.
This is usually not an easy discussion, as the solution often involves changes in business processes.
However, it is absolutely essential to get it right.
All the effort will be repaid many times over during the course of IAM program.


=== Nesting Organizational Units

We can synchronize the organizational units into midPoint.
We can set up the properties of organizational units.
However, organizational structures are usually hierarchical.
How to do we nest organizational units to create organizational tree?

In midPoint, organizational tree is formed by _assignments_.
Therefore the answer is quite simple: create the right assignments.
Clever reader is not paying attention any more, re-reading the sections on automatic role assignments in object template.
However, even a clever reader should pay attention here, as there is an easier way how to do it.
The assignments can be set up in the inbound mappings:

.resource-csv-org.xml
[source,xml]
----
            <attribute>
                <ref>ri:parentOrgNum</ref>
                <inbound>
                    <expression>
                        <assignmentTargetSearch>
                            <targetType>OrgType</targetType>
                            <filter>
                                <q:equal>
                                    <q:path>identifier</q:path>
                                    <expression>
                                        <path>$input</path>
                                    </expression>
                                </q:equal>
                            </filter>
                        </assignmentTargetSearch>
                    </expression>
                    <target>
                        <path>$focus/assignment</path>
                    </target>
                </inbound>
            </attribute>
----

This mapping automatically sets up an assignment to parent organizational unit.
We are lucky, we have almost ideal source of organizational data.
Our CSV file contains an identifier of a parent organizational unit in the `parentOrgNum` column.
All we need to do is to look for midPoint org that has that particular value in its `identifier` property.
This is done by the `assignmentTargetSearch` that we have already used for automatic assignment of roles in object template.
The same mechanism is reused here.

All that remains is to set up a synchronization task.
Make sure that you specify _kind_ and _intent_ in the synchronization task.
This is important, otherwise the tasks will not work.
Setting the right _kind_ and _intent_ was not emphasize before when we were synchronizing accounts.
The `account` _kind_ is the default and midPoint is usually smart enough to use default _intent_.
However, the defaults will no longer work when we go beyond the accounts.

.Troubleshooting
TIP: Generic synchronization can be confusing and there may be non-obvious configuration complexities.
When mis-configured, the synchronization mechanism often does nothing.
There is no error or any other obvious indication of an error.
Logging is your best friend in that case.
Enable logging of _synchronization service_ (`com.evolveum.midpoint.model.impl.sync`) at debug level.
MidPoint will log a reasonable amount of information about the synchronization process.
That information is very likely to lead you to the solution.

The configuration above will work for simple cases, but there is still a room for improvement.
The search filter in `assignmentTargetSearch` expression is quite simplistic.
It will match orgs from several trees if they have the same identifier.
The same problem is in the correlation query.
However, clever reader would surely find a way how to improve it.

Also, this method will work only if the data feed is correctly ordered.
Everything will work as long as parent organizational units are synchronized before child organizational units.
However, that is not always the case.
If ordering is wrong, child organizational units will not be able to find parent units, and the tree will disintegrate.
We are living in a networked concurrent world, data ordering is usually difficult to guarantee.

MidPoint has a mechanism to handle unordered data source.
There is a way how to create parent organizational units _on demand_.
When a child organizational unit looks for a parent that is not there yet, the parent object can be created at that moment.
Of course, this can only create _stub_ parent, a very minimal object that has only the essential data.
Yet, even such a _stub_ object is sufficient to create an organizational hierarchy.
The _stub_ will be updated later, when the details about parent organizational unit are retrieved from the data feed.
The details of this _create on demand_ mechanism is beyond the scope of this chapter.
We will get back to it later.


=== Adding Users To Units

We have a nice hierarchical organizational structure now.
Yet, something is still missing.
The organizational structure is all about the people, but there are no people in our organizational tree.
Let's fix this.

The people data are coming from HR resource in our ExAmPLE case.
We need to modify the HR resource to automatically assign people to the organizational tree.
To do that, we need to add information about organizational units into our HR feed.
After several phone calls, tens of e-mails and a quick 3-hour meeting, the HR department agreed to add a new `orgnum` column to the CSV file:

.hr.csv
[source,csv]
----
"empno","firstname","lastname","jobcode","orgnum"
"001","Alice","Anderson","S006","11100"
"002","Bob","Brown","S007","11210"
"003","Carol","Cooper","S008","11310"
...
----

The 'orgnum' column contains an identifier of the organizational unit the person belongs to.
This looks quite familiar, and clever reader is working on the configuration already.
Of course, we can use the same approach we have used to build up organizational hierarchy.
We just need to apply it to the users instead of organizational units.
Therefore we are going to add new inbound mapping to the HR resource:

.resource-csv-hr.xml
[source,xml]
----
            <attribute>
                <ref>ri:orgnum</ref>
                <inbound>
                    <expression>
                        <assignmentTargetSearch>
                            <targetType>OrgType</targetType>
                            <filter>
                                <q:equal>
                                    <q:path>identifier</q:path>
                                    <expression>
                                        <path>$input</path>
                                    </expression>
                                </q:equal>
                            </filter>
                        </assignmentTargetSearch>
                    </expression>
                    <target>
                        <path>$focus/assignment</path>
                    </target>
                </inbound>
            </attribute>
----

The `assignmentTargetSearch` expression looks for the right organizational unit.
Then the mapping creates an assignment to that unit.
And we are done.
Run the HR synchronization task, and all the users are going to be neatly organized in the tree.

.Get your data structures right at the beginning.
[TIP]
====
That 3-hour meeting with HR was in fact really useful and necessary.
The result was that ExAmPLE HR department did the right thing.
They put _identifier_ of organizational unit in the HR feed, instead of organizational unit _name_.
Having organizational unit _identifier_ makes everything much more stable.

There is a lesson to be learned.
Every hour spent designing the data structures will be repaid many times over.
Getting it wrong will cost you days or months dealing with data inconsistencies.
It is also very difficult to change data formats in the future, as they effectively become data integration interfaces.
Take your time and get it right at the beginning.

== Provisioning Organizational Structure

We have seen how we can synchronize organizational structure into midPoint.
We are talking midPoint here.
What goes in, can also go out.
It is very simple to provision organizational structure to an ordinary target system, such as database table.
However, we have already learned a thing or two, and doing that would be almost boring.
Therefore let's do something more challenging.
Let us synchronize the organizational structure into an LDAP directory tree.

The basic principles of organizational structure provisioning are the same as for users.
We need to set up _outbound mappings_ for organizational units.
We already know how to do that.
There are just few little differences:

* We will use `organizationalUnit` object class instead of `inetOrgPerson`.

* We will use special kind/intent combination.

* We have to be a bit smarter about creating LDAP distinguished names (DNs) for the entries, as we want them to create a hierarchical data structure.

Everything else is essentially the same as for users and accounts.
However, let us go over all the details step by step.

First of all, we need to add new `objectType` definition to the LDAP resource:

.resource-openldap.xml
[source,xml]
----
        <objectType>
            <kind>generic</kind>
            <intent>ou</intent>
            <displayName>Organizational Unit</displayName>
            <objectClass>ri:organizationalUnit</objectClass>
            <attribute>
                <ref>ri:dn</ref>
                <displayName>Distinguished Name</displayName>
                <limitations>
                    <minOccurs>0</minOccurs>
                    <maxOccurs>1</maxOccurs>
                </limitations>
                <outbound>
                    <name>ldap-ou-dn</name>
                    <trace>true</trace>
                    <source>
                        <path>$focus/name</path>
                    </source>
                    <expression>
                        <script>
                            <code>
                                import javax.naming.ldap.Rdn
                                import javax.naming.ldap.LdapName

                                // We will collect names of the org units in the orgpath list
                                // We cannot add them to dn yet as we need their order to be reversed
                                def orgpath = []
                                def node = focus
                                while (true) {
                                    log.debug("processing node {}", node)
                                    orgpath.add(node.displayName.orig)
                                    if (node.parentOrgRef == null || node.parentOrgRef.isEmpty()) {
                                        break
                                    } else {
                                        node = midpoint.resolveReference(node.parentOrgRef[0])
                                    }
                                }

                                log.debug("orgpath={}", orgpath)
                                def dn = new LdapName('ou=org,dc=example,dc=com')
                                orgpath.reverse().each { ouname -> dn.add(new Rdn('ou',ouname)) }
                                return dn.toString()
                            </code>
                        </script>
                    </expression>
                </outbound>
            </attribute>
            <attribute>
                <ref>ri:ou</ref>
                <limitations>
                    <maxOccurs>1</maxOccurs>
                </limitations>
                <outbound>
                    <source>
                        <path>$focus/displayName</path>
                    </source>
                </outbound>
            </attribute>
        </objectType>
----

Except for that big piece of Groovy code, this configuration is relatively simple.
The `objectType` definition specifies `organizationalUnit` value for object class.
This is a standard LDAP object class for "ou" entries.
There is also specification of kind (`generic`) and intent (`ou`).
These are midPoint "coordinates" for this object type.
Then we have two _outbound_ mappings, one for LDAP distinguished name (`dn`), the other for naming attribute (`ou`).
The `ou` mapping is very simple, using a value of org's `displayName`.
On the other hand, the `dn` mapping looks somehow scary.
There is no need to be afraid.
We are going to explain everything, and there are some really interesting parts here.

The purpose of this mapping is to construct LDAP distinguished name in a hierarchical manner.
We want to put the organizational tree under the `ou=org,dc=example,dc=com` entry, with the entry for ExAmPLE company at the top.
Therefore the `dn` of Operations Division need to be `ou=Operations Division,ou=ExAmPLE,ou=org,dc=example,dc=com`.
IT Department goes under the Operations Division, therefore we need its `dn` to be `ou=IT Department,ou=Operations Division,ou=ExAmPLE,ou=org,dc=example,dc=com`.
We need to process the tree from the organizational unit all the way through all the parent units to the very top of organizational structure.
That is exactly the thing that the Groovy expression does.

Let's skip the `import` statements for now.
The first thing that the expression has to do is to figure out the "path" from the current organizational unit to the top of the tree.
The expression gets the current organizational unit in the `focus` variable.
However, the org object does not contain its complete path in the tree.
All it has is a reference to its parent organizational unit (`parentOrgRef`).
Therefore the expression has to iterate over all the levels in the tree until it gets to the top.
The top organizational unit does not have any parent, that is where the iteration stops.
Display names of each organizational unit at the "path" is collected in the `orgpath` list.
As the org contains only a reference to the parent, we need to explicitly read the parent object from midPoint repository.
We will do that with an explicit call to `midpoint.resolveReference(...)` method.
This method reads the object from the database and returns it.
When the loop stops, `orgpath` contains all the display names that we want in our `dn`.
Now we need to encode the names in LDAP DN format.
This can be done by simple string operations.
However, there are some intricate details about escaping the names as they are encoded.
It would be nice if someone else could do the encoding for us.
Turns out, there is someone else to do it.
Java platform comes with Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), which is supposed to be a generic library to access broad range of directory services.
JNDI is not the best library that the world has ever seen, but it is part of Java platform and it can do formatting of LDAP DN.
It will be good enough for us.
We will take advantage of `LdapName` and `Rdn` classes to encode the DN.
The `import` statements at the beginning made use of these classes quite convenient.
The last detail is the ordering.
We want our names in the DN to be in a different order, therefore we just reverse `orgpath` before processing.

Clever reader has noticed a couple of interesting things in that mapping.
Especially the `<trace>` element looks very useful, which it is.
It turns on detailed tracing of the mapping.
MidPoint will record the details of mapping evaluation in the log file.
Similar `<trace>` element can also be applied at the expression level.
Then there are the `log` statements in the Groovy code, such as `log.debug("processing node {}", node)`.
These are explicit logging statements.
The `processing node ...` message is recorded to the log file at debug level.
This is a very useful tool for diagnosing execution of complex expressions.

Our outbound mappings are ready to go.
But nothing happens yet.
MidPoint does not know that it is supposed to create LDAP objects for our organizational units.
MidPoint does not automatically create accounts for all the users either.
We need a _construction_ to do that.
The orgs need to have an assignment with an constuction, similar to these that we have used to create accounts.
However, we will need to use the right _kind_ and _intent_.
We want to archive something like this:

[source,xml]
----
<org oid="7a1feb50-471f-11ea-8aab-1b2627541f15">
    <name>F11000</name>
    <displayName>Sales and Marketing Division</displayName>
    ...
    <assignment>
        <construction>
            <!-- LDAP resource -->
            <resourceRef oid="8a83b1a4-be18-11e6-ae84-7301fdab1d7c"/>
            <kind>generic</kind>
            <intent>ou</intent>
        </construction>
    </assignment>
</org>
----

You can test your configuration by creating this assignment manually in the GUI, or by editing the XML/JSON/YAML version of the org.
However, we need to create these assignments automatically.
There are several ways to do it.

Perhaps the most obvious way would be to add a mapping to create this assignment in the object template.
As there is an object template for users (`UserType`), there may be an object template for any other midPoint object.
Therefore, you can create object template for orgs (`OrgType`) and configure the mapping there.
This would be an acceptable solution.

An alternative way would be to add _inbound_ mapping to create this assignment.
That would be in fact quite easy, as it would is very similar to the mapping that we have used to create organizational hierarchy.
However, that would not be an ideal configuration, as would would mix the _concerns_ here.
The mapping will be an _inbound_ mapping in the `Organizational Chart` resource.
It would not be entirely appropriate for this _inbound_ mapping to control provisioning (i.e. _outbound_ flow) of organizational structure.
It will work, but such configuration will be difficult to understand and maintain.

Clever reader is not thinking about the _metaroles_ that we have already mentioned in the RBAC chapter.
As usual, cleaver reader is right, or perhaps very close to the right solution.
Creating a _metarole_ that could be applied to all the orgs would be almost an ideal solution:

.role-meta-orgunit.xml
[source,xml]
----
<role oid="b8c3ccba-1dfb-11eb-9031-27e1d26ca36e">
    <name>Functional Organizational Unit Metarole</name>
    <inducement>
        <construction>
            <!-- LDAP resource -->
            <resourceRef oid="8a83b1a4-be18-11e6-ae84-7301fdab1d7c"/>
            <kind>generic</kind>
            <intent>ou</intent>
        </construction>
    </inducement>
</role>
----

This metarole can be assigned to every org that we want to provision.
In such case, it is perfectly good to have the mapping to assign the meta role even in the _inbound_ part of the `Organizational Chart` resource.
The metarole specifies type of the organizational unit.
Therefore it is desirable to set the metarole when the org is created for the first time, which happens during organizational structure synchronization.

This would be almost ideal solution.
However, there is a better way still.
We can use _archetype_ instead of metarole.
Archetype will do the same trick as metarole does here.

.archetype-orgunit.xml
[source,xml]
----
<archetype oid="475106e4-1dfe-11eb-8429-534869969212">
    <name>Functional Organizational Unit</name>
    <inducement>
        <construction>
            <!-- LDAP resource -->
            <resourceRef oid="8a83b1a4-be18-11e6-ae84-7301fdab1d7c"/>
            <kind>generic</kind>
            <intent>ou</intent>
        </construction>
    </inducement>
</archetype>
----

Archetype can do even more tricks than metarole.
Archetype can specify an icon and a color for the objects.
It can control the assignments to these objects.
Archetypes give a structure to midPoint objects.
We will get back to archetypes in a dedicated chapter.

For now, just choose any of the methods above to trigger provisioning of organizational structure.
We will go for the archetype, assigning it automatically in inbound mappings of `Organizational Chart` resource:

.resource-csv-org.xml
[source,xml]
----
        ...
        <objectType>
            ...
            <objectClass>ri:AccountObjectClass</objectClass>
            <kind>generic</kind>
            <intent>orgunit</intent>
            <attribute>
                <ref>ri:orgnum</ref>
                ...
                <inbound>
                    <expression>
                        <value>
                            <targetRef oid="475106e4-1dfe-11eb-8429-534869969212" type="ArchetypeType"/>
                        </value>
                    </expression>
                    <target>
                        <path>$focus/assignment</path>
                    </target>
                </inbound>
            </attribute>
            ...
        </objectType>
        ...
----

All we need to do now is to re-run the synchronization task.
The result is a nice organizational structure in LDAP directory:

.Organizational strucutre in LDAP
image::09-11-ldap-org-tree.png[Organizational strucutre in LDAP]

This is a nice result.
However, there are still several remarks to make.

If you are going to try this scenario with a real LDAP server, you will need to create a root entry for the organizational structure (`ou=org,dc=example,dc=com`).
You will also need to update access control lists (ACLs).
However, be warned that this is not a very ideal way how to maintain organizational structure in LDAP directory.
We are using display names here, which are part of LDAP identifiers (DNs).
Therefore even a minor correction in organizational unit name will trigger LDAP rename operation.
It will change the identifier of the organizational unit, and also all the organizational units below it.
Perhaps the only thing that can make it worse is to place _users_ in that structure as well.
Which some people actually do.
The only real reason to put organizational structure in this form is to satisfy the needs of legacy applications.
Avoid this approach whenever you can.

The clever reader have surely noticed that the big Groovy expression above is explicitly fetching objects from the database.
This may cause a performance problem in case that such expression is evaluated often or if the strucutre is very deep.
This is usually not the case with ordinary organizational structures, therefore this approach is usually not problematic.
However, it is always a good thing to keep performance in mind, especially if your user population is bigger than few thousands of users.

Finally, we still depend on ordering of the data feed.
We want to create "higher" entries in LDAP first, otherwise an attempt to create "lower" entries would fail.
This can be solved by using the "create on demand" approach mentioned above.
However, it is going to be problematic and cumbersome when organizational unit display names are used instead of indetifiers.
It does not matter that much anyway, as it is likely you will suffer for many different reasons if organizational display names are used.
Always use organizational unit identifiers if you can.

== Focus and Projection

Synchronization of an organizational structure is an application of a _generic synchronization_ principle.
Almost any resource object can be synchronized with almost any midPoint object - and vice versa.
