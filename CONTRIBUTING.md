# Contributing

You may submit contributions to the book source code, provided such contributions are not interfering with copyright.
For example, spelling corrections, minor wording improvements and formatting fixes are acceptable contributions, assuming the author is not claiming copyright on any part of the book.
Other (more substantial) contributions that interfere with the copyright might be acceptable.
However, in such case, please contact Evolveum to settle the legal issue before making a contribution.
