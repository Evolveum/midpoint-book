[quote, Bilbo Baggins, 'The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien']
It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door. You step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's no knowing where you might be swept off to.

Many years ago we started a project.
Because we had to.
Back then we didn't think too much about business and markets and things like that.
We were focused on the technology.
And the project simply went on.
It had its ups and downs â€“ but all the time there was pure engineering passion.
The effort brought fruits and now there is a product like no other: midPoint.

MidPoint is an identity management and governance system.
We built it from scratch.
It is a comprehensive and feature-rich system.
MidPoint can handle complete identity lifecycle management and some parts of identity governance and compliance.
It can speed up the process that create accounts for new employee.
MidPoint can automatically disable accounts of an employee after his contract has expired.
MidPoint manages assignment of roles and privileges to employees, partners, agents, contractors, customers or students.
MidPoint keeps an eye that the policies are continually maintained and enforced.
It governs the processes of access reviews. It provides auditing and reporting based on the identity data.
And recent midPoint versions are heading towards the field of compliance: management of new and changed policies, evaluation how compliant is your setup according to those policies and governing smooth adoption of the policies.
