[quote,"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish by Douglas Adams"]
Eskimos had over two hundred different words for snow, without which their conversation would probably have got very monotonous.

Identity management and governance parlance may sound like an alien language to a newcomer.
Therefore, perhaps preparing IDMish-to-english dictionary might be a good idea.

There are a lot of terms listed in this part of the book.
Many of the terms have several meanings, some of them might be confusing, and there are alternative terms and various "dialects".
Identity management, similarly to many fields of technology, is also riddled by many buzzwords, invented by marketing departments rather than scientists and engineers.
Therefore, compiling a clear, simple, exact and consistent terminology is almost an impossible task.
We have tried to do our best here.

Individual terms are accompanied by acronyms and alternative terms where appropriate.
There is also a reference to vocabularies used by standards.
Some terms have specific meaning when used in midPoint ecosystem.
In that case the midPoint-specific meaning is explained as well.

Although the glossary is certainly incomplete, and we reserve the right for our own interpretation, we hope that this will help you safely navigate the stormy waters of identity management letter soup.

[glossary]
[[glossterm-abac]]Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)::
A mechanism for managing user access to information systems based on user attribute values. Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) evaluates access dynamically using an algorithm that takes 'attributes' as input and outputs an access decision (allow/deny). The attributes are usually user profile attributes, supplemented with context attributes such as time of access and the user's current location.
+
Alternative terms: Claims-based Access Control, CBAC
+
See also: <<glossterm-access-control,Access Control>>
[[glossterm-abstract-role]]Abstract Role::

+
In midPoint terminology: Abstract role means any type of object that acts as a role. This means that abstract tole can be used to hold inducements, which give privileges to other objects. Role, org, service, archetype are abstract roles in midPoint.
+

[[glossterm-access-certification]]Access Certification::
Access certification helps with management of access rights. These rights also called privileges, role assignments, authorities or authorizations need to be assigned to the right users in the right systems at the right time. Access Certification means reviewing the settings such as assignments of roles to users to make sure that employees have accesses to the systems they need.
+
Certifications are often conducted in a form of certification campaigns, certifying access of many users in each campaign, distributing the work among many reviewers to keep amount of work per person reasonable. Despite that, the overall effort necessary for completion of certification campaign can be huge. Therefore, certification campaigns are being replaced by microcertifications, certifying specific users or privileges on as-needed basis.
+
Access certification is often used to address over-provisioning of privileges, in a attempt to maintain the principle of least privilege.
+
Alternative terms: Access Re-certification, Re-certification, Attestation, Access Review
+
See also: <<glossterm-least-privilege,Least Privilege Principle>>, <<glossterm-over-provisioning,Over-provisioning>>, <<glossterm-microcertification,Microcertification>>
[[glossterm-access-cloning]]Access Cloning::
Access cloning is a practice of assigning a user the same access rights as another user has. It is often used to provision new users with initial access rights, copying access rights of an existing user.
+
Access cloning is an undesirable practice (see ISO/IEC 27002 5.18), as it often leads to over-provisioning. Even if the cloned access rights are justified, business role (RBAC) or similar mechanism should be used instead of cloning. Although the practice is generally undesirable, it is often employed due to its simplicity.
+
Alternative terms: Access Rights Cloning
+
See also: <<glossterm-least-privilege,Least Privilege Principle>>, <<glossterm-over-provisioning,Over-provisioning>>, <<glossterm-rbac,Role-Based Access Control>>
[[glossterm-access-control]]Access Control::
Access control is an abstract concept of controlling access of users to applications. It is a very broad and general term, however it usually refers to a mechanism to define and evaluate authorization policies. Two commonly-used access control mechanisms are role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC).
+
X.1252 term: access control
+
See also: <<glossterm-rbac,Role-Based Access Control>>, <<glossterm-abac,Attribute-Based Access Control>>, <<glossterm-pbac,Policy-Based Access Control>>
[[glossterm-access-management]]Access Management (AM)::
Access Management (AM) is a security discipline that provides access to authorised users to enter particular resources. It also prevents non-authorised users from accessing the resources. Thus the goal of Access Management is to unify the security mechanisms that take place when a user is accessing specific system or functionality. Single Sign-On (SSO) is sometimes considered to be a part of Access Management.
[[glossterm-access-request]]Access Request Process::
Access request process is a business process used to request additional access or privileges for information systems and applications. It is usually a semi-manual process. It starts with a user requesting access or privileges for applications. The request is usually routed through approval steps. When approved, the access is provisioned.
+
Access request is very frequently used to provide necessary access to users, addressing access under-provisioning situations. As clear and complete access control policy is usually not known, access request process is a practical measure to compensate for this limitation. In fact, the access request process is often over-used, leading to systematic over-provisioning of access. Access certification mechanisms are usually used to compensate such over-provisioning.
+
Alternative terms: Access Request Management
+
See also: <<glossterm-identity-provisioning,Identity Provisioning>>, <<glossterm-under-provisioning,Under-provisioning>>, <<glossterm-over-provisioning,Over-provisioning>>, <<glossterm-access-certification,Access Certification>>
[[glossterm-account]]Account::
Data structure in a database, file or a similar data store that describes characteristics of a user of a particular system (resource). Accounts are used to control access of users to applications, databases and so on. Account is a persistent data record, stored in an application or a database. This term is usually not used to describe ephemeral information about user's identity, such as information temporarily stored only for the duration of user's session. Such information is often referred to as "principal".
+
Account is different from a generic data record (e.g. "identity" or "principal"). The purpose of account is to provide user's access to the system, generic data record may not provide such access.
+
In midPoint terminology: An account strictly means a data structure in source/target system (resource). Term "user" is used to describe a similar data structure in midPoint itself.
+
Alternative terms: User account
+
See also: <<glossterm-user,User>>, <<glossterm-principal,Principal>>
[[glossterm-acl]]Access Control List (ACL)::
Mechanism for controlling access to information system, based on a simple sequential list of access control instructions. Instructions in access control list are evaluated sequentially. If the instruction matches current access control situation (user, accessed object, operation), then the instruction is applied, either allowing or denying the access.
+
There is no standardized form or language for access control lists and instructions, making ACLs not interoperable across implementations. There are also numerous variations to the basic idea, e.g. always evaluating entire list, deny instructions always taking precedence, and so on.
+
See also: <<glossterm-access-control,Access Control>>
[[glossterm-active-directory]]Active Directory::
An identity repository created by Microsoft that stores and arranges identity information. Based on this information, it provides access and permissions to users to enter particular resources and therefore improves organizationâ€™s security.
[[glossterm-agent]]Agent::
Active entity, usually a software component that plays an active part.
+
In identity management field, the term "agent" often means an active software component installed into a controlled system, used to mediate management of identities. It is similar in function to identity connector, however unlike the connector, the agent has to be installed into a controlled system.
+
X.1252 term: agent
+
See also: <<glossterm-identity-connector,Identity Connector>>
[[glossterm-anonymity]]Anonymity::
A situation when an object cannot be distinguished from similar objects, where an identity of an object cannot be determined.
+
X.1252 term: anonymity
+
See also: <<glossterm-identity,Identity>>
[[glossterm-api]]Application Programming Interface (API)::
Set of procedures, functions or methods that can be used by another program or component. APIs are usually interfaces exposed by an application, meant to be used by other application. Therefore APIs are important integration points between applications and services. In the past, APIs were usually created as a programming language library, such as C or Java library. Since c. 2010, APIs usually take form of HTTP-based RESTful service.
+
See also: <<glossterm-restful-service,RESTful Service>>
[[glossterm-archetype]]Archetype::

+
In midPoint terminology: Archetype is a formal definition of object subtype in midPoint. Archetypes can give specific characters to basic midPoint types such as user, role or org. For example, archetypes can be used to further refine concept of user to represent employees, students, contractors and partners.
+
See also link:https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/schema/archetypes/[more information at docs.evolveum.com].
[[glossterm-asset]]Asset::
Assert is an integral collection of information, data, systems, services, equipment, knowledge and any other means that provide value to an organization. It may take form of customer database, results of a research project, trade secret, proprietary software package, essential business process or any form that is considered valuable. Assets are subjects to risk, realized by threats exploiting asset vulnerabilities. Protection of assets is the primary objective of cybersecurity.
+
Alternative terms: Information asset
+
See also: <<glossterm-risk,Risk>>, <<glossterm-threat,Threat>>, <<glossterm-vulnerability,Vulnerability>>, <<glossterm-risk-assessment,Risk assessment>>
[[glossterm-assignment]]Assignment::

+
In midPoint terminology: Assignment is a relation that directly assigns privileges, organizational membership, policy elements or other midPoint concepts to assignment holder objects (usually users). Assignment is quite a rich, flexible and universal mechanism. Assignments can be conditional, there may be time constraints, parameters and other details specifying the relation between assignment holder (usually user) and target (usually role or org). Many types of objects can be a target of an assignment, allowing for a significant expressive power.
+
See also link:https://docs.evolveum.com/midpoint/reference/roles-policies/assignment/[more information at docs.evolveum.com].
+
See also: <<glossterm-inducement,Inducement>>, <<glossterm-assignment-holder,Assignment Holder>>, <<glossterm-focus,Focus>>
[[glossterm-assignment-holder]]Assignment Holder::

+
In midPoint terminology: An object that can hold assignments. Assignment holder can be considered a "source" of an assignment, a source of a relation that an assignmnt represents. Almost all object types in midPoint are assignment holder, capable of containing an assignment.
+
See also: <<glossterm-assignment,Assignment>>, <<glossterm-focus,Focus>>
[[glossterm-audit]]Audit::
Audit is an systematic and documented process for reviewing specific processes, organizations or regulatory compliance. It involves obtaining and objective processing of evidence, including evidence stored in special-purpose audit trails. Audit can be internal, conducted by an organization, reviewing its own processes or compliance. It can also be external, conducted by an independent trusted party.
+
See also: <<glossterm-audit-trail,Audit trail>>
[[glossterm-audit-scope]]Audit scope::
Extent and boundaries of audit review.
+
See also: <<glossterm-audit,Audit>>
[[glossterm-audit-trail]]Audit trail::
Audit trail is a record of essential information, meant to be used as an evidence in audit reviews. Audit trail is usually a structured, chronological record of operations or observations of an information system. It records important actions taken by users of the system, including actions taken by system administrators.
+
Alternative terms: Audit log
+
See also: <<glossterm-audit,Audit>>
[[glossterm-authentication]]Authentication::
Authentication is a mechanism by which a computer system checks that the user is really the one she or he claims to be. Authentication can be implemented by a broad variety of mechanisms broadly divided into three categories: something you know, something you have, something you are. Traditionally, authentication is done by the means of by username and password. Authentication is often followed by authorization, however, authentication and authorization are two separate mechanisms.
+
ISO 24760 term: authentication
+
X.1252 term: authentication
+
See also: <<glossterm-identification,Identification>>, <<glossterm-authorization,Authorization>>, <<glossterm-mfa,Multi-factor authentication>>
[[glossterm-authenticated-identity]]Authenticated Identity::
ISO 24760 term, describing "identity information" created to record result of authentication. This may mean data such as authentication strength, timestamps and similar information. In software development, it is often referred to as "authenticated user" or "authenticated principal".
+
Alternative terms: Authenticated user, Authenticated principal
+
ISO 24760 term: authenticated identity
+
See also: <<glossterm-authentication,Authentication>>, <<glossterm-principal,Principal>>
[[glossterm-authenticator]]Authenticator::
Something the subject possesses and controls, which is used to prove the identity during authentication. Authenticator can be digital (information), physical (an object such as ID card or authentication device) or a combination of both (an ID card with a tamper-proof chip containing cryptographic keys). Perhaps the most common type of authenticator is a password.
+
The term "authenticator" is closely related to term "credential" - which is even more confusing as many authenticators are also credentials. The difference is that credential is bound to the authenticated identity, while authenticator does not need to be. E.g. password is not inherently bound to authenticated identity, as the same password can be used to authenticate many identities at various sites. Therefore, strictly speaking, password is an authenticator but not a credential. On the other end, digital certificate (X.509) with associated private key is bound to a specific identity, therefore it is both an authenticator and a credential. There are also credentials that are not authenticators, such as records in the authentication database linking identity identifiers. However, in common usage, the term "credential" is often used to refer to authenticators as well.
+
Alternative terms: Authentication token
+
ISO 24760 term: credential
+
X.1252 term: credential
+
See also: <<glossterm-credential,Credential>>, <<glossterm-password,Password>>, <<glossterm-passkey,Passkey>>, <<glossterm-pin,Personal identification number>>, <<glossterm-authentication,Authentication>>
[[glossterm-authenticity]]Authenticity::
Authenticity is a property of a data, and also an assurance, that the data are valid and true. Simply speaking, it tells that data are what they claim to be. Authenticity may also mean assurance of data origin (provenance) and their integrity.
+
See also: <<glossterm-integrity,integrity>>
[[glossterm-authorization]]Authorization::
Authorization is a mechanism by which a computer system determines whether to allow or deny specific action to a user. Authorization is often controlled by rather complex rules and algorithms, usually specified as part of an access control model. Authorization often follows (and required) authentication, however, authentication and authorization are two separate mechanisms.
+
In rare cases, "authorization" is understood as a process of allowing access, granting permissions or giving approval. Such as "authorization" of a request to join a group.
+
X.1252 term: authorization
+
See also: <<glossterm-authentication,Authentication>>, <<glossterm-rbac,Role-Based Access Control>>, <<glossterm-abac,Attribute-Based Access Control>>, <<glossterm-coarse-grain-authorization,Coarse-grain Authorization>>, <<glossterm-fine-grain-authorization,Fine-Grain Authorization>>, <<glossterm-access-control,Access Control>>
[[glossterm-authorization-service]]Authorization Service::
A system that provides authorization information to an application. It usually makes a decision whether a specific operation should be allowed or denied by the application. I.e. authorization system is performing the authorization decision instead of the application. Authorization systems often use complex policy, user roles or additional attributes to make the decision. Authorization servers usually implement functionality of Policy Decision Point (PDP). Typical protocols and frameworks: XACML, Open Policy Agent (OPA), SAML authorization assertions, proprietary mechanisms
+
Alternative terms: Authorization Server
+
See also: <<glossterm-authorization,Authorization>>
[[glossterm-availability]]Availability::
Availability is a property of network service or information system, ensuring that all the necessary functions are available to the user. I.e. it is a property that ensures that systems and the data are available to users as intended, that the service is not interrupted by an attacker.
+
Availability, together with confidentiality and integrity form a "CIA triad", a classical model of information security (cybersecurity).
+
Alternative terms: Service availability
+
See also: <<glossterm-confidentiality,Confidentiality>>, <<glossterm-integrity,integrity>>
[[glossterm-biometrics]]Biometrics::
Automated recognition of persons, based on their biological or behavioral characteristics.
+
Alternative terms: Biometric authentication
+
X.1252 term: biometric recognition
+
See also: <<glossterm-authentication,Authentication>>
[[glossterm-birthright]]Birthright::
Privileges or access granted to users based on their inherent characteristic, such as user type (employee, contractor, student). It also includes a set of privileges automatically given to all users ("all users" access). Privileges and access that are automatically assigned due to organizational structure membership (e.g. access to departmental systems) is sometimes also considered to be a birthright.
+
In midPoint terminology: Archetypes are usually used to manage birthright in midPoint, by placing appropriate inducements in archetype definition. Birthright originating from organizational structure can be implemented by placing inducements in organizational units (orgs).
+
Alternative terms: Birthright provisioning
+
See also: <<glossterm-provisioning,>>, <<glossterm-archetype,Archetype>>, <<glossterm-org,Org>>, <<glossterm-inducement,Inducement>>
[[glossterm-blinded-affirmation]]Blinded Affirmation::
A method to provide strictly limited information to another party, without revealing any unintended information. Blinded affirmation is often used to demonstrate that a certain user is a member of an organization, without revealing any additional information about the user to a third party. Blinded affirmation usually relies on ephemeral identifiers or pseudonyms.
+
ISO 24760 term: blinded affirmation
+
See also: <<glossterm-ephemeral-identifier,Ephemeral Identifier>>, <<glossterm-pseudonym,Pseudonym>>
[[glossterm-certificate-authority]]Certificate Authority (CA)::
Entity that issues digital certificates. Certificate authority is usually a trusted third party, certifying correctness of the data presented in certificates that it issues. The most common form of certificate authority is an authority that issues X.509 digital certificates, containing public keys. Certificate authority signs the certificates, thus certifying that a specified public key belongs to a specified identity.
+
See also: <<glossterm-digital-certificate,Digital Certificate>>, <<glossterm-trusted-third-party,Trusted Third Party>>
[[glossterm-claim]]Claim::
Statement about an entity, provided in a form which can be verified by other parties. Verification of a claim provides reliable information about the entity that created the claim (issuer), and it provides assurance that the claim content was not modified. However, claim verification does not provide assurance that a claim is correct, or that it is an unquestionable truth. Technically, claims are often digital identity attributes, secured by cryptography mechanisms for network transfer.
+
See also: <<glossterm-digital-identity-attribute,Digital Identity Attribute>>, <<glossterm-triangle-of-trust,Triangle Of Trust>>, <<glossterm-issuer,Issuer>>, <<glossterm-holder,Holder>>, <<glossterm-verifier,Verifier>>

[[glossterm-cloud-computing]]Cloud Computing::
Internet-based computing when resources like storage, applications or servers are used by organizations or users via Internet. Data could be accessed any time from any place, without any installations and is stored and processed in third-party data centers which could be located anywhere in the world. Cloud computing is considered to lower organizationâ€™s costs by avoiding the need of purchasing servers as well as to speed up the processes with less maintenance needed. Due to data being centralized at one place, it is considered to be secure and easily shared across bigger amount of users.
[[glossterm-coarse-grain-authorization]]Coarse-grain Authorization::
Authorization concerning big architectural blocks, such as entire applications or systems. E.g. coarse-grain authorization usually decides whether a user can access an application, or access should be denied, without providing any additional details. Coarse-grained authentication is usually being made at the "perimeter" of the system, e.g. by infrastructure components, when a user is accessing an application. Typically, this authorization is based on simple policy rules, such as a role or group assigned to the user.
+
See also: <<glossterm-authentication,Authentication>>, <<glossterm-fine-grain-authorization,Fine-Grain Authorization>>
[[glossterm-competence]]Competence::
Ability to perform certain function, or to achieve intended results. It may refer to the ability of people, an ability to apply knowledge, skills and effort to reach results. It may also apply to systems, describing an ability of the system to perform functions to achieve results.

+
Confidentiality, together with integrity and availability form a "CIA triad", a classical model of information security (cybersecurity).
+
Alternative terms: Secrecy
+
See also: <<glossterm-availability,Availability>>, <<glossterm-integrity,integrity>>
[[glossterm-connid]]ConnId::

[[glossterm-consent-for-personal-data-processing]]Consent for Personal Data Processing::
Consent for personal data processing is given by a user, to indicate agreement for processing of personal data. In personal data protection frameworks (such as GDPR), consent has a strict structure, it is given for a very specific processing scope. Consent can be revoked by the user any time. Consent is just one of several personal data processing bases (lawful bases). Consent is perhaps the most well know, and also the most misused basis for personal data processing.
+
Alternative terms: Consent

+
See also: <<glossterm-compliance,Compliance>>, <<glossterm-remediation,Remediation>>
[[glossterm-credential]]Credential::
Information used to prove the identity of a subject during authentication, which is bound to that particular identity. Credentials can be digital (information), physical (an object such as ID card) or a combination of both (an ID card with a tamper-proof chip containing cryptographic keys). Perhaps the most common type of digital credential is a password-based credential.
+
The term "credential" is closely related to term "authenticator" - which is even more confusing as many authenticators are also credentials. The difference is that credential is bound to the authenticated identity, while authenticator does not need to be. E.g. password is not inherently bound to authenticated identity, as the same password can be used to authenticate many identities at various sites. Therefore, strictly speaking, password is an authenticator but not a credential. However, when password is established as a shared secret at a particular site, and bound to a particular identity in that site's authentication database, a password-based credential is created. On the other end, digital certificate (X.509) with associated private key is bound to a specific identity, therefore it is both an authenticator and a credential. There are also credentials that are not authenticators, such as records in the authentication database linking identity identifiers. However, in common usage, the term "credential" is often used to refer to authenticators as well.

ISO 24760 term: credential service provider
+
See also: <<glossterm-credential,Credential>>
[[glossterm-cross-domain]]Cross-domain::
Anything that involves interaction between two or more domains. Specifically in context of identity and access management, it usually means transfer of information between domains that are under separate control, or transfer of information that needs to be somehow limited (e.g. only a subset of attributes is transferred).
+
Cross-domain techniques employ special mechanism to protect the information, or to make transfer between domains more reliable or secure. For example, special identifiers (often ephemeral pseudonyms) are used to refer to identity data.

[[glossterm-identification]]Identification::
A process of recognizing an identity as distinct from other identities in a particular scope or context. Identification is almost always performed by processing identifiers, using them to reference an identity in an identity database.
+
Identification is a process distinct from authentication. Authentication is a process of proving an identity (verification), whereas identification does not assume any such proof.
+
The term "identification" usually refers to a process of looking up identity data based on a simple identifier, such as username or reference identifier. In some cases, process of identification involves a correlation, looking up or matching identity information in a more complex way. For example, a system may compare registration data entered by the user with the content of its identity database, in an attempt to determine whether such user is already registered.

[[glossterm-identity-based-security]]Identity-based Security::
Identity-based security is a approach to cybersecurity, focused on concept of identity. It places identities in the center of cybersecurity mind-set, adjusting cybersecurity design and practices around identities. Identity-based security is concerned with the identity that initiates an action, or identity that is responsible for an action, object or configuration. Simply speaking, identity-based security tries to make sure that access to service or information is provided to a specific identity, and only to the identity that is entitled for such access. Identity-based security is not limited to identity of persons. Identities of machines, services, devices, networks and similar technological and virtual concepts (non-human identities, NHI) are included as well.
+
Identity-based security relies on dynamic policies based on the identity of the actor, as well as context of the operation or situation. Unlike traditional approaches, identity-based security is not fixed, it does not assume static world where an operation is allowed once and for all, and stays allowed for ever. Policies in identity-based security are dynamic, they are meant to be continuously applied, maintained, reviewed and improved, dynamically adapting to the environment and requirements.
+
Identity-based security is fundamental foundation for zero-trust approach.
+
Note: Identity-based security should not be confused with "identity security", which is a vastly overloaded term used mostly for marketing purposes.
+
Alternative terms: Identity-first security, Identity-centric security

[[glossterm-identity-correlation]]Identity Correlation::
Process of comparing identity information, with an aim to find a matching identity. Correlation is usually employed during identity enrollment or registration, when a system determines whether the new identity is already known to the system. For example, a system may compare registration data entered by the user with the content of its identity database, in an attempt to determine whether such user is already registered. If such a comparison involves simple and reliable identifiers (such as username or employee number), it is called "identification". However, in many cases such identifiers are not available, and the system needs to combine several identifiers or employ sophisticated techniques to find matching identity. Some identity correlation techniques involve probabilistic matching techniques or machine learning methods to find suitable candidates, which are later reviewed by human operator.
+
Alternative terms: Identity Matching

[[glossterm-identity-data-source]]Identity Data Source::
A system that is the source of identity data, usually data about users. The data are usually created and maintained in such systems manually. There are often multiple identity data sources in an organization with various characteristics. Some data sources are considered authoritative, providing reliable information about identities. Other data sources usually contain user-provided information, such as data entered by the user during registration process. Almost all data sources contain partial information only, information that is limited both in breadth (only some identity types) and depth (only some attributes). Data source may be an intermediary, providing information acquired from other systems.
+
Alternative terms: Source System
[[glossterm-identity-data-store]]Identity Data Store::
A database, designed and/or dedicated to store identity-related data. Identity data store is usually shared among many applications, it is accessed by many systems reading the data. Applications read data from identity data stores, often using them for authorization, and sometimes even authentication purposes. Structure of data in the data store is often application-friendly, containing pre-processed and derived information. Identity data store also usually contain entitlements, or similar information that can be used for authorization purposes. There are usually several identity data stores in an organization, managed and synchronized by an identity management system.
+
Traditionally, directory servers (such as LDAP serves) are used as identity data stores.
+
Identity data store is similar to identity register, and in fact many identity data stores are identity registers. The difference is that identity register has a more formal data structure, usually functioning as an authoritative data source. Whereas identity data store usually contains information copied from other system, including application-friendly derived data. However, the exact boundary between functions of identity register and identity data store is not exactly defined.
+
Alternative terms: Identity Store, Identity Database, Directory Service

See also: <<glossterm-identity-register,Identity Register>>
[[glossterm-identity-deprovisioning]]Identity Deprovisioning::
Identity deprovisioning is as well as identity provisioning a subfield of Identity and Access Management (IAM). It is an opposite to identity provisioning. While identity provisioning takes care of creating new accounts, determining the roles for individual users and their rights or making changes in them, deprovisioning works oppositely. When an employee leaves the company, his account is deactivated or deleted and he loses all the accesses to both internal and external systems. This way organization minimizes information theft and stays secure. Identity provisioning together with deprovisioning and associated activities is known as "fulfillment".
+
Alternative terms: Deprovisioning, Revocation

Set of identity stages from creation to its deactivation or deletion. It contains creation of an account, assignment of correct groups and permissions, setting and resetting passwords and in the end deactivation or deletion of the account.
+
Alternative terms: Identity lifecycle management
+

[[glossterm-identity-management]]Identity Management (IDM)::
Identity Management (IDM) is a process of managing digital identities and their accesses to specific resources in the cyberspace. It ensures appropriate access in appropriate time and helps to manage user accounts as well as to synchronize data. Identity management deals with digital identity lifecycle, managing values of digital identity attributes and entitlements.
+
Alternative terms: Identity Administration, User management, User provisioning
+
ISO 24760 term: identity management
+

[[glossterm-identity-management-system]]Identity Management System (IDMS)::
A system that provides identity management functionality: it is managing identities and their accesses to specific resources in the cyberspace. It ensures appropriate access in appropriate time and helps to manage user accounts as well as to synchronize data.
+
Identity management (IDM) systems are concerned about the "management" side, maintaining user data, policies, roles, entitlements and so on. IDM systems usually do not "apply" or enforce the policies. The policies are transformed as needed and provisioned to other systems (a.k.a. "target systems") that interpret and enforce the policies. The process of provisioning (and "deprovisioning") of data and policies is known as "fulfillment".
+
In a broad sense, IDM systems are used to manage the policies and data in all connected systems in the organization. IDM systems make sure that the data are consistent, that all the policies are applied, that user profile data are up-to-date, detecting and removing illegal access and generally keep all identity-related information in order across all the systems.
+
Note: ISO 24760 definition seems to include identification and authentication as functions of identity management systems. While almost all IDM systems implement such functions, they are mostly used for internal purposes, e.g. for system administration access. IDM system usually do not provide identification and authentication services to other systems. ISO 24760 definition is closer to definition of identity and access management (IAM) system. However, complete IAM functionality is usually provided by a combination of several systems in practice.
+
Alternative terms: IDM System, Provisioning System, User Provisioning System

[[glossterm-identity-proofing]]Identity Proofing::
Verification of evidence to make sure that identity information are true and up-to-date. Identity proofing is used to achieve higher level of assurance of identity information.
+
Identity proofing should not be confused with authentication. Identity proofing is used to establish the link between identities and/or subjects/entities. However, identity proofing does not necessarily provide assurance that the entity currently interacting with a service is in fact the same entity that was initially established.
+
Alternative terms: Initial Entity Authentication
+
ISO 24760 term: identity proofing

[[glossterm-identity-provider]]Identity Provider (IdP)::
System that provides identity-related information to applications (known in this context as "relying party" or "service provider"). Such information usually includes user identifiers (which may be ephemeral), user name(s) and affiliation. The information is usually provided in form of identity assertions (claims).
+
Identity providers are often authenticating the users. In that case, identity providers usually include information describing the authentication, such as statement that user was authenticated and indication of authentication mechanism strength. Identity provider authenticates the users in its own capacity, it never reveals user's credentials to the application (relying party). In fact, many identity providers are focused on authentication only, providing only a very minimal identity information (often just a single identifier), in which case the authentication-related information forms the most important part of provided information. Such identity providers effectively work as cross-domain single sign-on (SSO) systems.
+
Although most identity providers include user authentication, there are also providers that do not (directly) authenticate the users, sometimes called "attribute providers". Identity provider may provide also additional information of the user to the application, such as information about user attributes and entitlements.
+
Identity provider is often managed by a different organization than the relying applications (service providers), thus providing cross-domain identity mechanism. Typical protocols and frameworks used by identity providers include: SAML, OpenID Connect, CAS
+

[[glossterm-identity-provisioning]]Identity Provisioning::
In broad sense, identity provisioning is a subfield of Identity Management (IDM), concerned with technical aspects of creating user accounts, groups and other objects in target systems. It is a technology thanks to which many identity stores are synchronized, merged and maintained. Identity provisioning takes care of technical tasks during the whole user lifecycle - when new employee is hired, when his responsibilities change or he leaves the company (deprovisioning). It helps the organization to work more effectively as its goal is to automate as much as possible.
+
The provisioning system usually takes information about employees from the Human Resource (HR) system. When new employee is recorded into HR system, this information is detected and pulled by the provisioning system. After that, it is processed to determine set of roles each user should have. These roles determine and create accounts users should have, so everything is ready for new users on the very first day. If a user is transferred to another department or his privileges change, similar processes happen again. If an employee leaves the company, identity provisioning systems makes sure all his accounts are closed.
+
In a specific sense, identity provisioning means a process of creating accounts, assigning entitlements and similar actions, making sure a user has appropriate access to information systems. Identity provisioning together with deprovisioning and associated activities is known as "fulfillment".
+
Alternative terms: User provisioning, Provisioning
+

[[glossterm-identity-register]]Identity Register::
A repository (database) of identity information, usually structured in a formal manner. Identity registers are almost always indexed using a reference identifier. They are usually designed for a specific purpose of being an authoritative data sources for other systems.
+
Identity register is similar to identity data store, and in fact many identity registers function as identity data stores. The difference is that identity data store has less formal, usually application-friendly data structure, containing pre-processed and derived information. Identity data store also usually contain entitlements, or information that can be used for authorization purposes. However, the exact boundary between functions of identity register and identity data store is not exactly defined.
+
Alternative terms: IMS Register, Reference Register
+
ISO 24760 term: identity register

[[glossterm-identity-registration]]Identity Registration::
A process of recording new identity data into identity register or identity data store. Registration process may involve storing the information is several distinct data stores or registers. The recording process may be indirect, e.g. mediated by synchronization process of an identity management system.
+
Informally, the registration process often involves the data acquisition process as well, such as asking user for the data using a form.
+
The terms "enrollment", "registration" and "onboarding" are overlapping and they are often used as synonyms. Strictly speaking, "enrollment" is the verification process, "registration" is an act of recording information to data store, and "onboarding" is a complete business process making sure that a new person in an organization is well-equipped for activities within the organization.
+
Alternative terms: Registration

[[glossterm-identity-resource]]Identity Resource::
In IAM field, a Resource is usually a network-accessible asset capable of managing identity information.
+
In midPoint terminology: An Resource is a system that is either identity data source or provisioning target. IDM system (midPoint) is managing accounts in that system, feeding data from that system or doing any other combination of identity management operations. Identity resource should not be confused with "web resource" that is used by RESTful APIs.
+
Alternative terms: Provisioning Resource, Resource
+
See also: <<glossterm-resource,Resource>>, <<glossterm-identity-connector,Identity Connector>>
[[glossterm-identity-security]]Identity Security::
Identity security is a vastly overloaded term, usually used for marketing purposes. Depending on the entity describing "identity security", its meaning can range from low-level network security to a high-level identity governance. The common motif seems to be focus on securing the identities, whether the identities represent persons, services or devices, which is a very broad and vague description. Overall, "identity security" does not bring any significant new concept or approach, it is mostly just a marketing description of pre-existing technology and methods.
+
Identity security should not be confused with identity-based security, which is a valid approach to cybersecurity.
+

[[glossterm-identity-vigilance]]Identity Vigilance::
Identity vigilance is a practice of appropriate and responsible management of identity data. It includes proper synchronization of data among information systems and databases, identification of duplicates, handling of data inconsistencies, application of privacy protection and all other practices necessary to ensure that the data are always correct, up-to-date and protected. Identity vigilance is especially important in healthcare, where patient mis-identification or data errors may lead to fatal consequences.

[[glossterm-iga]]Identity Governance and Administration (IGA)::
Identity governance and administration (IGA) si a subfield of identity and access management (IAM) dealing with management and governance of identity-related information. IGA systems store, synchronize and manage identity information, such as user profiles. Complex data, entitlement and governance polices can be defined, applied to identity data. IGA system are responsible for evaluating the policies, making sure the data are compliant, addressing policy violations. IGA is often considered an umbrella term covering identity management, identity governance, compliance management, identity-based risk management and other aspects related to management of identities. Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) includes both the technical and business aspects of identity management.
+
IGA provides basic foundational platform for identity-based security, zero trust approach, and many other cybersecurity techniques and approaches.

[[glossterm-inducement]]Inducement::

+
In midPoint terminology: Inducement is an indirect representation of an assignment, a relation that assigns privileges, organizational membership, policy elements or other midPoint concepts to assignment holder objects (usually users). Inducement has the same data structure as assignment, and very similar functionality. However, while assignment represents direct relation, inducement is indirect. For example, assignment can be used to assign an account or a group membership directly to a user. Inducement can facilitate the same functionality, however it is usually placed in role. As the role is assigned (using an assignment) to the user, inducements placed in the role are indirectly applied to a user.

[[glossterm-joiner-mover-leaver]]Joiner-Mover-Leaver Processes (JML)::
Joiner-Mover-Leaver (JML) are human resources (HR) process, handling employees joining the organization, moving within organizational structure and leaving the organization. JML process can be understood as handling events of employee lifecycle from the point of view of organizational and business processes. Generally speaking, this process is not limited to employees. However, when similar processes are applied to other types of persons (students, contractors) they are often referred to as "on-boarding" and "off-boarding".
+
JML processes are (manual) business processes in their nature. Despite that, the JML processes are important for identity management, as they provide the contextual framework for identity management technology to fit in. Moreover, identity management deployments are usually automating some parts of the JML processes.

[[glossterm-least-privilege]]Least Privilege Principle::
Principle of information security, stating that each user should have the least privilege necessary to carry out their activities. In other words, the principle states that there should be no over-provisioning (over-permissioning) of users. The principle is often implemented by "default deny" approach: everything is denied by default, every access has to be explicitly allowed.
+
Adherence to the principle of least privilege is generally accepted as best practice for information security, as it is minimizing overall risk by keeping the extent of privileges as low as possible. However, due to complexity, maintenance effort and other factors, strict adherence to the principle is surprisingly difficult to achieve.
+
Alternative terms: Principle of Least Privilege, Default deny

Alternative terms: Goal
[[glossterm-offboarding]]Offboarding::
Business process that takes place when a person leaves an organization. The aim of offboarding is making sure that the person no longer has access to sensitive data and premises of the organization. From IT point of view, this often means identity de-provisioning, e.i. deactivation of user accounts in various applications, databases and identity data stores. This process is often automated using an identity management system. However, a complete offboarding process is usually more complex, including non-IT steps such as returning the provided equipment.

[[glossterm-open-source]]Open Source (OSS)::
The meaning of this term is very simple - it is something people can wilfully modify according to their own needs or wishes. Firstly, this term was known in the context of software, which code was publicly exposed and available for modification. Later open source spread widely. There are open source projects, products, participations and many others.
+
Many organizations and people choose open source software, hence it is considered to be more secured and grants people more control over it. This software can also be more stable as many other people may contribute their own ideas, correct it or improve it.

[[glossterm-orphan-account]]Orphan Account::
An account without an owner, an account that does not seem to belong to anybody. In identity management, each account is supposed to have an owner, a user to whom the account belongs. An account without an owner is considered to be "orphaned", and it is usually deprovisioned (disabled or deleted).
+
Orphan accounts often originate as testing accounts that are not deleted after the testing is done. They may also belong to former users, but were not properly deleted or disabled. Orphan accounts are almost always a security risk, especially testing accounts with weak passwords. Most identity management systems have processes that scan systems for orphan accounts.
+
Alternative terms: Orphan, Orphaned Account
+

[[glossterm-outsourcing]]Outsourcing::
Outsourcing is a practice of delegating functions, tasks and responsibilities to an external organization.
[[glossterm-over-provisioning]]Over-provisioning::
Situation when an identity has more privileges than are necessary for the tasks that the identity is supposed to carry out.
+
Over-provisioning is generally undesirable, as it is a violation of least privilege principle which is introducing unnecessary risk. However, over-provisioning is a common occurrence, mostly due to high complexity of access control models, limited visibility, huge privilege maintenance effort or lack of appropriate security management practices.
+
Alternative terms: Over-permissioning, Over-privileged Access
+

[[glossterm-pap]]Policy Administration Point (PAP)::
Functional component with a responsibility to specify, manage and maintain the policy. The "policy" usually refers to access control and/or authorization policy. PAP is an administrative point, which is creating and managing the policy. The policy is then stored at policy retrieval point (PRP). Policy administration point (PAP) can be part of applications, or they may be provided by dedicated infrastructure components (identity management and governance components). PAP specifies the policy, usually as a result of interaction with an administrator by the means user interface. PAP does not make policy decisions or enforce them, that is a responsibility of policy decision point (PDP) and policy enforcement point (PEP) respectively.
+
Note: The acronym PAP may also refer to Policy Access Point, which is an alternative name for Policy Retrieval Point (PRP), making the terminology somehow confusing.
+
Alternative terms: Policy Management Point
+

[[glossterm-passkey]]Passkey::
Passkey is a type of strong digital credential. They are used to authenticate a user to information systems, identity provides and applications. Passkeys are based on public key cryptography, making them relatively strong and secure. They may be provided in a hardware form (e.g. a small USB device), or managed entirely in software (e.g. mobile application). Passkeys are bound for each website or application, making them phishing-resistant.
+
See also: <<glossterm-credential,Credential>>, <<glossterm-pin,Personal identification number>>
[[glossterm-password]]Password::
Password is a type of (usualy weak) digital credential, meant to be secret, known only to a single user. Passwords are memorized secret authenticators, usually selected by users, meant to be remembered. Therefore, they are often short strings in a human-friendly form, such as simple words or names. Simplicity of passwords makes them vulnerable to dictionary attacks. Recently, passwords are randomly generated, managed by password management applications. However, even randomly-generated passwords may still be vulnerable to phishing attacks. Therefore organizations are moving towards authentication methods that do not depend on passwords (e.g. passkeys), or enroll multi-factor authentication schemes.
+
Alternative terms: Passcode

[[glossterm-passwordless-authentication]]Passwordless authentication::
Passwordless authentication is an authentication that does not use passwords, or similar knowledge-based credential. It is usually considered to be a stronger form of authentication that the usual password-based authentication. Password-less authentication mechanisms usually rely on public-key cryptography mechanisms.
+
Alternative terms: Passwordless
+
See also: <<glossterm-authentication,Authentication>>, <<glossterm-password,Password>>, <<glossterm-passkey,Passkey>>, <<glossterm-mfa,Multi-factor authentication>>
[[glossterm-password-policy]]Password policy::
Password policy constraints the selection and use of passwords with an aim to make them more secure. It almost always sets requirements for password complexity, such as minimal length of passwords and characted classes used in the password (e.g. letters, numbers, punctuation). Password policies often specify constraints on password lifetime, such as password expiration intervals.
+
Alternative terms: Password complexity policy
+
See also: <<glossterm-password,Password>>, <<glossterm-password-management,Password Management>>
[[glossterm-password-management]]Password Management::
Gives the organization an opportunity to meet the highest security standards thanks to the ability of having access to business systems and networks under control. Most of the employees usually pick just simple passwords and use same ones in multiple systems or applications. Password management helps to compose strong and unique passwords for both users and resources and ideally takes care of them during the whole user life cycle.
+
The term "password management" may also mean management of password on the user side, such as generating and storing of random passwords.
+
Alternative terms: Credential management
+
See also: <<glossterm-password,Password>>, <<glossterm-credential,Credential>>
[[glossterm-pbac]]Policy-Based Access Control (PBAC)::
A mechanism for managing of user access to information systems based on policy. In PBAC, authorizations are supposed to be dynamically evaluated, based on policy specified in a machine-processable form. PBAC policy is an abstract concept, it is not clearly defined how it is expressed or evaluated. PBAC is meant to solve problems of static access control models such as RBAC.
+
PBAC seems to be technically equivalent to ABAC. However, in contrast to ABAC, PBAC is supposed to contain "policy management" layer, which is not clearly defined either.
+
Overall, PBAC is an conceptual idea rather than a concrete access control model. It is still in early stages of development.
+
Alternative terms: Dynamic Authorization Management, Policy as Code
+

[[glossterm-pep]]Policy Enforcement Point (PEP)::
Functional component with a responsibility to enforce policy decisions. The "policy" usually refers to access control and/or authorization policy. Policy enforcement points are usually part of applications or infrastructure components, with an ability to analyze and intercept policed operation. Policy enforcement point only enforces the policy, it does not interpret or decides the policy. PEP depends on policy decision point (PDP) to interpret the policy and make a decision.
+

[[glossterm-performance]]Performance::
Performance is a measure of a result. In process management, it a measure of how well is a process or activity achieving its objectives. The term "performance" may also meat a measure of efficiency of a computer system, describing how quickly it can provide results and how much resources it needs to perform a task.
[[glossterm-perimeter]]Perimeter::
Security perimeter is a boundary that separates secure and insecure areas. In cybersecurity, "perimeter" separated insecure outer network (usually the Internet) and secure inner network (usually corporate network). The perimeter was usually implemented by physical protection of network devices and connections, inter-connecting networks by the means of dedicated security devices (firewalls, gateways). Security requirements were significantly reduced in the presumably-secure inner network, usually to the point of no tangible security at all. Access control inside the perimeter was often limited to access control based on network addresses (IP-based access control), or even no practical access control was implemented at all.
+
Reliance on cybersecurity perimeter was a very common occurrence in early years of inter-network computing. However, concept of cybersecurity perimeter is fundamentally flawed, as computer networks are no longer bound to their physical form. Existence of virtual networking technologies, wireless networks, covert network channels and other technologies made cybersecurity perimeter unsustainable. This effect is further emphasized by move towards cloud services, that are located outside of classic security perimeter by their very nature.
+
Overall, cybersecurity perimeter is considered flawed and insecure approach. Zero trust approach provides a broad conceptual movement to migrate from the concept of cybersecurity perimeter to more resilient and holistic cybersecurity approach that does not rely on concept of perimeter.
+
Alternative terms: Security perimeter, Information security perimeter, Network perimeter, Cybersecurity perimeter
+
See also: <<glossterm-zero-trust,Zero trust>>
[[glossterm-persistent-identifier]]Persistent Identifier::
An identifier that cannot be changed or re-assigned to another identity. Once assigned, the identifier always references the same identity. Persistent identifiers are usually used as reference identifiers, and reference identifiers are usually persistent, resulting in "persistent reference identifiers".
+
Depending on a policy, persistent identifiers can be re-assign to another identity after the original identity was deleted (identifier re-use). However, there is usually relatively long interval during which the identifier cannot be re-assigned.
+
Alternative terms: Non-reassignable identifier
+
See also: <<glossterm-identifier,Identifier>>, <<glossterm-reference-identifier,Reference Identifier>>
[[glossterm-personal-data]]Personal Data::
Data about a person, usually processed in an information system. The definition of "personal data" slightly differ from case to case. For example, GDPR defines personal data as "any information which are related to an identified or identifiable natural person". However, the general understanding is that "personal data" are any data that relate to a natural person, that describe the person in some way. This is different from personally identifiable information (PII), as personal data may not uniquely identify a person. For example, person's full name is considered personal data, however, a name such as "John Smith" is not entirely unique or identifiable in most contexts.
+
Alternative terms: Personal information, Identity data, Identity information, Personal profile
+

[[glossterm-personal-data-erasure]]Personal Data Erasure::
Erasure (deletion) of personal data, usually due to explicit request from user (e.g. "delete account" request), or due to lack of lawful basis for personal data processing.
+
Alternative terms: Erasure, Data erasure

See also: <<glossterm-personal-data-protection,Personal Data Protection>>, <<glossterm-personal-data,Personal Data>>, <<glossterm-personal-data-processing-basis,Personal Data Processing Basis>>, <<glossterm-gdpr,General Data Protection Regulation>>
[[glossterm-personal-data-processing-basis]]Personal Data Processing Basis::
Basis for processing of personal data. Legal data protection frameworks (such as GDPR) usually mandate that personal data cannot be processed unless there is a basis for that processing. The basis may be a contract, legal obligation, consent, or similar legitimate interest for processing of the data. Some frameworks (such as GDPR) are enumerating the available processing bases.
+
Alternative terms: Basis for processing, Legal basis, Lawful basis
+

[[glossterm-personal-data-protection]]Personal Data Protection::
Personal data protection is a field dealing with protection of personal information, rules for their processing, storage and erasure. It is closely related to privacy, as one of the main goals of personal data protection is to limit exposure of personal data, thus minimizing potential for their abuse.
+
Alternative terms: Data Protection, DP
+
See also: <<glossterm-personal-data,Personal Data>>, <<glossterm-gdpr,General Data Protection Regulation>>
[[glossterm-personally-identifiable-information]]Personally Identifiable Information (PII)::
Information that allows a person to be (directly or indirectly) identified. Obviously, government-issued identifiers, such as birth numbers, social security numbers or serial numbers of various identity documents are usually considered to be personally identifiable information. However, interpretation of what information is "personally identifiable" depends on the context. Even a simple full name of a person may be considered personally identifiable information in some contexts. Personally identifiable information usually require special protection or processing regime. Personally identifiable information should not be confused with personal data. PII are used as an identifier, pointing out a specific person in a group of other persons. Personal data describe certain person, there is no requirement for personal data to be "identifiable".
+
Alternative terms: Personal identifiers
+
X.1252 term: personally identifiable information
+
See also: <<glossterm-personal-data,Personal Data>>
[[glossterm-pdp]]Policy Decision Point (PDP)::
Functional component with a responsibility to interpret policy and make decisions. The "policy" usually refers to access control and/or authorization policy. Policy decision point (PDP) can be part of applications, or they may be provided by dedicated infrastructure components (authorization services). PDP interprets the policy and make a decision, which is usually allow/deny decision. PDP does not enforce the decision, it relies on policy enforcement point (PEP) to enforce it. PDP does not define or manage the policy either, it depends on policy administration point (PAP) to set the policy.

[[glossterm-pdrbac]]Policy-Driven Role-Based Access Control::
A mechanism for managing of user access to information systems based on a concept of dynamic roles and policies. It is an extension of traditional Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), applying dynamic policies to govern behaviour and assignment of roles. In policy-driven RBAC, roles are no longer static, they contain logic that determines set of privileges given by the role. The user-role assignments are also dynamic, controlled by automatic role assignment policies.
+

[[glossterm-pin]]Personal identification number (PIN)::
Personal identification number (PIN) is a type of authenticator, meant to be secret, known only to a single user. They are almost always in a form of short numbers (4-8 digits). PINs are memorized secret authenticators. Even though most PINs are randomly generated, they are meant to be remembered by the users. Simplicity of PINs makes them vulnerable to enumeration attacks when used on their own. Therefore PINs they are almost exclusively used in combination with other authenticators. E.g. PINs are often used to protect strong authenticators/credentials, such as passkeys or public key credentials stored on smart cards.

[[glossterm-policy]]Policy::
Policy is a system of guidelines or rules used to reach an objective or a decision.
+
Unfortunately, "policy" is a heavily overloaded term with numerous of meanings. It may mean organizational policy, a set of high-level guidelines interpreted by people to guide their decisions. Policy may be formal, written down in a form that can be strictly followed, where compliance with a policy can be evaluated. It may also be informal, expressed in non-exact form, specifying a vague objective and methods. Policy may also mean machine-processable and executable code, used to quickly reach authorization decisions in run-time.
+

[[glossterm-policy-management]]Policy Management::
Set of operations defining the authorization roles or policies, or assigning roles to the particular users. This is often manual or semi-manual operation performed in identity management system or identity data store. Policy management is implementing the functionality of Policy Administration Point (PAP).
+
This term is often confused with authorization itself. However, policy management aims at definition of the policy, while authorization is interpreting the policy.
+
See also link:https://docs.evolveum.com/iam/iga/policy-and-role-management/[more information at docs.evolveum.com].

[[glossterm-polystring]]Polystring::
A built-in data type for polymorphic string maintaining extra values in addition to its original value. The extra values are derived from the original value automatically using a normalization code. PolyString supports national characters in strings. It contains both the original value (with national characters) and normalized value (without national characters). This can be used for transliteration of national characters in usernames. All the values are stored in the repository, therefore they can be used to look for the object. Search ignoring the difference in diacritics or search by transliterated value can be used even if the repository itself does not support such feature explicitly.
[[glossterm-principal]]Principal::
An entity or identity, information about which is managed in an information system.
+
Usage of the term "principal" varies significantly. Depending on context, it may refer to entity (person), its identity or data structure describing parts of the identity (digital identity). In information security frameworks (such as X.509), "principal" usually refers to entity or identity, such as owner of credentials. In programming frameworks, "principal" usually refers to ephemeral information about user, maintained during user's session. This is usually different from "account", as accounts are usually persistent (stored in database), while principal may be ephemeral, or may refer to entities that are not users of the system (may not be able to log in). In some contexts, "principal" is equivalent to "subject".
+
Alternative terms: Subject
+
ISO 24760 term: principal

+
See also: <<glossterm-privacy-enhancing-technology,Privacy-Enhancing Technology>>, <<glossterm-personal-data-protection,Personal Data Protection>>
[[glossterm-privacy-enhancing-technology]]Privacy-Enhancing Technology (PET)::
Technologies that support and enhance privacy. This usually means technologies that give an individual an effective control over personal data, and the way how these data are used to express one's individuality.
+
Most privacy-enhancing technologies are focused on limiting the spread of personal data, making sure that only a minimal amount of data is disclosed (minimal disclosure), making sure that user approves data transfer (consent), using pseudonyms and various anonymization techniques to limit data exposure.
+
Privacy-enhancing technologies are somewhat different from personal data protection technologies. While privacy-enhancing technologies are focused on limiting exposure of the data (secrecy), data protection technologies are focused on controlling the way how data are used.

[[glossterm-privileged-entitlement]]Privileged entitlement::
Entitlement (access right, privilege) that allows the performance of activities that typical entities in the system cannot perform. User with privileged entitlement can usually perform activities that goes far beyond usual usage of the system. Privileged entitlements may allow unrestricted access to data, allow modification of entitlements of other users, and often include destructive operations such as deletion of data sets. System administration privileges are almost always considered privileged entitlements.

[[glossterm-projection]]Projection::

+
In midPoint terminology: Projection is a part of midPoint computation that represents the objects in identity resources, usually accounts, entitlements or organizational units. Projection are the "spokes" in hub-and-spoke (star) data synchronization in midPoint. Projections are represented in the computation in a form of shadows (shadow objects), usually supplemented with real-time data from the resource objects.

[[glossterm-prp]]Policy Retrieval Point (PRP)::
Functional component with a responsibility to store and distribute policies for use by policy decision points (PDP). PRP acts as an repository for policy. The policy is usually stored persistently at PRP, e.g. in a form of a file or database. Primary responsibility of PRP is to make policy available to policy decision points (PDP), either by "pull" (PDP retrieving the policy from PRP) or by "push" (PRP sending the policy to PDP). PRP is instrumental in enabling distributed architecture with several PDPs.
+
Note: PRP is only storing and distributing the policy, it is not responsible for policy creation or management. Policy management is responsibility of policy administration point (PAP).

[[glossterm-pseudonym]]Pseudonym::
An identifier designed to avoid any inherent information about identity or entity. Pseudonyms are meant to hide or modify perception of the entity or identity, as presented to other parties.
+
In user experience sense, pseudonyms can be chosen by the user to hide or alter their real identity in information systems.
+
In implementation sense, pseudonym is often a randomly-generated identifier, used selectively for communication with specific domain or system. The pseudonym is used instead of other identifiers to avoid possibility of the other party to reveal parts of user's identity or correlate user's actions.
+
ISO 24760 term: pseudonym

+
See also: <<glossterm-private-key,Private Key>>
[[glossterm-rbac]]Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)::
A mechanism for managing of user access to information systems based on a concept of roles. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is using roles to group permissions. Roles usually represent meaningful entities, such as job positions, organizational affiliations or similar business concepts. One of the basic assumptions of RBAC is that management of roles is much easier than management of individual permissions.
+
A form of RBAC is standardized in a series of NIST standards (ANSI/INCITS 359-2004, INCITS 359-2012).
+
RBAC is mostly concerned with using the roles to control user access to the system and other information assets. Role definitions are usually maintained using a somehow separate "Role Management" mechanisms.
+
Traditional RBAC models are static: user-role and role-permission relations are fixed, set up by system administrator. Newer RBAC models are dynamic (policy-driven): user-role and role-permission relations may be dynamic, determined by policy (algorithm).
+

[[glossterm-reconciliation]]Reconciliation::
In identity management, reconciliation is a process of comparing recorded state od identity management system with a real state of identity resources. In the most common form, reconciliation is comparing user data stored in identity management database with account data stored in identity resource (source or target systems). Reconciliation is meant to detect differences in the data, including detection of orphaned accounts.
+
Reconciliation is usually quite heavyweight, yet very reliable mechanism of identity data synchronization.
+

[[glossterm-rebac]]Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)::
A mechanism for managing of user access to information systems based on a concept of relationship. Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC) is defined by presence of relationship between objects, such as "owner" or "editor". The relationships are interpreted by an access control policy to form access control decisions.
+
In midPoint terminology: MidPoint has a concept of "relation" that can be used together with assignment/inducement mechanism to implement ReBAC access control structures.
+

[[glossterm-reference-identifier]]Reference Identifier (RI)::
An identifier that reliably references an identity in a particular scope. Once assigned, the identifier always references the same identity, it cannot be assigned to a different identity. Reference identifiers are often persistent, however, they can change, as long as the identifier is not re-assigned to other identity.
+
Depending on a policy, reference identifiers can be re-assign to another identity after the original identity was deleted (identifier re-use). However, there is usually relatively long interval during which the identifier cannot be re-assigned.
+
Alternative terms: Non-reassignable identifier
+
ISO 24760 term: reference identifier

ISO 24760 term: reference identifier generator
+
See also: <<glossterm-reference-identifier,Reference Identifier>>, <<glossterm-enrollment,Enrollment>>, <<glossterm-identity-registration,Identity Registration>>
[[glossterm-referential-integrity]]Referential Integrity::
Consistency constraint in a database, mandating that every reference points to a valid object. Simply speaking, when an identifier is used to reference another object, such objects should exist.
+
Referential integrity is often a concern in group management and directory services. Systems that provide referential integrity make sure that a group points to valid members (user that exist), or that a list of user groups points to valid groups. In case a user who is a member of a group is removed, a system with referential integrity will either automatically remove the user from the group, or it will deny the operation until user is explicitly removed from all groups first. Systems that do not provide referential integrity would allow such operation, leaving invalid identifier in the database, an identifier that does not point to any existing object.

[[glossterm-static-entitlement]]Static Entitlement::
An entitlement that is statically assigned to a user or an account. The entitlement stays ("stands") assigned to a user indefinitely, until it is explicitly unassigned. Static entitlement is assigned to a user by an action of system administrator, by the means of access request process or by similar means.
+
Standing entitlement forms a basis of some access control models, most notably Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Static nature of the entitlement assignment is often a target of critique, stating the lack of dynamics and flexibility of static entitlements. Policy-based access control models avoid use of standing entitlements in favor of entitlements that are determined dynamically in run-time.
+
While static entitlements may be necessary at higher levels (especially identity governance level), they may not necessarily be reflected to lower levels (e.g. directory services and operating systems). Eliminating low-level standing privilege has several advantages, including lower risk of misuse and less visibility for the attacker. Just-in-time or on-demand mechanisms for temporary assignment of privileged access provides a solution for bridging high-level and low-level static entitlements.
+
Alternative terms: Standing Privilege, Standing Entitlement, Persistent Privileges

[[glossterm-verifier]]Verifier::
Entity that performs verification, usually a verification of an credential or a claim. In Triangle of Trust scenarios, the verifier verifies credentials/claims provided by the holder. Verifier may need information provided by the issuer of credential/claim to be able to complete the verification process.

[[glossterm-zero-trust]]Zero trust (ZTA)::
"Zero trust" is an approach to cybersecurity based on the concept of "never trust, always verify". The basic idea of the approach is to never trust any system or network implicitly, always verify that the request is authentic both with respect to the identity of the source and trustworthiness of network channels. Under zero trust, every request should be authenticated and authorized. For that approach to work, all relevant identities must be reliably known, especially non-human identities (NHI) representing communicating services and devices. Therefore, identity-based security is a fundamental foundation for zero trust approach.
+
Zero trust originated mostly as a reaction to flawed concept of cybersecurity perimeter, which was a common approach to cybersecurity in early years of inter-network computing. Cybersecurity perimeter approach allowed for existence of "perimeter" that separated insecure outer network (usually the Internet) and secure inner network (usually corporate network). Security requirements were significantly reduced in the presumably-secure inner network. In that respect, zero trust can be summarized as "no weak interior", an approach in which no assumption of secure inner network exists. Zero trust approach is operating under "assumption of breach", meaning that it is assumed that the attacker already has access to the network, devices or services.
+
Overall, "zero trust" is mostly a broad conceptual approach - a set of guiding principles, rather than a set of specific technologies and practices. It is currently used as a token of paradigm shift from perimeter-based approach to more resilient and holistic cybersecurity approach that does not rely on concept of perimeter.
