[quote, Henry Adams]
Chaos was the law of nature; Order was the dream of man.

MidPoint is an open source identity management (IDM) and identity governance system.
It is a very rich and sophisticated system that provides many advanced features.
MidPoint is maintained by Evolveum – a company dedicated to open source development.
All midPoint core developers work for Evolveum.
However, there are also partners and other engineers that are contributing to midPoint development.

MidPoint is a second-generation IDM system.
There are few veterans in midPoint development team that deployed first-generation IDM systems since early 2000s.
That was not always a pleasant experience.
Therefore in 2011 we started midPoint project to correct the mistakes of early IDM systems.
One of the main differences between midPoint and other IDM systems is that midPoint is designed and implemented with one primary goal in mind: to be practical.
We had been dealing (and struggling) with first-generation IDM systems in the past and we do not want to live through that experience again.
Therefore practicality goes very deep into the very foundations of midPoint.
To be more concrete, practicality means:

* Things that are simple or used often should be easy to configure.
Propagation of changed password, user enable/disable, account synchronization – these should be as easy as possible.
As simple as flicking a switch or setting few configuration properties.

* Things that are more complex or used less frequently may be a bit harder.
Such as editing XML or JSON file or writing few lines of Groovy or Python script.

* Things that are very complex or very unusual should be still possible.
However these might not be easy.
It may require longer scripts or implementing some Java classes.
It may require forking and modifying the source code.
But it must be possible to do almost anything.

This means that simple solutions which do not deviate from the usual requirements will be easy to implement.
Most IAM programs start like this.
This approach allows to gain the benefits very early in the project.
The effort grows as the requirements are getting more complex and more unusual.
But the effort is still much lower than implementing everything from scratch.
And there is always an option to stop the project at any point where the costs are getting too high to justify the benefits.
MidPoint is an open source system.
Therefore there is no license cost that would offset the initial costs.
Even small projects are feasible with midPoint.

Simply speaking, midPoint is following the Pareto principle: 20% effort brings 80% benefits.
There are many mechanisms that support this approach.
Some are based in midPoint design, some originate from midPoint development practices and some are even supported by the Evolveum business model.
But more about that later.

== How MidPoint Works

MidPoint does what any identity management system is supposed to do: it manages identities.
The very basic functionality of midPoint is the synchronization of identity data that are stored in various applications, databases, directory servers, text files and so on.
We call all these systems _resources_.
MidPoint is using _connectors_ to reach the resources.
MidPoint can propagate change that happened in one resource to other resources.
E.g. an employee record appears in the HR system, it is picked up by midPoint, processed, transformed and then new Active Directory and CRM accounts are created.
This is the process that we call _synchronization_.

image::02-01-midpoint.png[midPoint]

MidPoint has a rich graphical user interface (GUI) that can be used to manage the identities.
Changes made by system administrators are automatically propagated to all affected resources.
E.g. security officer disables a user by clicking on disable button in midPoint user interface.
Then MidPoint makes sure that all accounts that belong to the user are immediately disabled.

image::02-02-midpoint-gui.png[midPoint GUI]

This is the essence of midPoint operation.
This may sound simple, but this description is extremely simplified.
The reality is much more complicated.
Most of the important things happen inside midPoint before the changes are applied to target resources.
This may look simple at the first sight, but it is not.
For each change that midPoint detects it needs to evaluate:

* *Roles:* MidPoint computes where the user should have access.
This is usually given by the roles that the user has.
The role structure is often quite rich.
There may be hierarchical roles, parametric roles, conditional roles and a lot of other advanced mechanisms.

* *Organizational structure:* Users usually belong to some organizational units, projects, teams or groups.
Some of them may give additional privileges to the user.

* *Status and life cycle:* Accounts can be created, enabled, disabled, archived or deleted.
There are many situations that need to be processed.
E.g. we may want to create a disabled account one week before a new employee starts his work, enable the account on his first day, disable the account on his last day and delete it three months after he leaves.

* *Attributes and identifiers:* Simple synchronization scenarios assume that attributes and values will be the same in all the synchronized systems.
That is a nice theory, bit it almost never works like that in real world.
Attribute names need to be translated, values need to be transformed, data types need to be converted.
This is different for each system and even for each instance of each system.
Small algorithms in form of scripting expressions are usually needed to properly transform the values.

* *Credential management:* Password changes need to be propagated to the resources.
Sometimes we want to synchronize password with all systems, sometimes we want just a subset of systems.
Password policies need to be evaluated, password history needs to be checked, password may need to be encoded and hashed before storage.

* *Consistency:* The account in the target application might have changed since midPoint has updated it.
The current change may no longer be applicable to the current state of the account.
The change that midPoint wants to make may conflict with the native change, the change may be partially applied already, the account may have attribute values that it should not have or the account may not exist at all.
MidPoint has to detect such situations are react accordingly, e.g. by re-creating a deleted account before applying the changes.

* *Approvals:* MidPoint determines if any of the changes need to be approved before they are applied.
If that is the case then midPoint drives the request through an approval process.

* *Notifications:* MidPoint notifies the user that he can access a new account.
It notifies the administrator if something goes wrong.

* *Audit:* MidPoint records all the changes into an audit trail.
This can later by used by security officers or specialized analytic engines.

This is a lot of things to process, evaluate and execute.
Some of these steps are quite complex.
And indeed there are many complex algorithms implemented in midPoint.
There are algorithms that evaluate complex role structures, organizational structures, temporal constraints, password policies and so on.
The only thing that is needed is to configure them properly.

However, midPoint does even more than that.
MidPoint does not only manage identities, it can also manage any object that is anyhow related to identity management.
MidPoint can manage roles, role catalogs, organizational structures, groups, projects, teams, services, devices and almost any other object.

MidPoint is also an _identity governance system_.
The job of identity management features is to make sure that the policies are consistently applied through the organization.
The governance features assist with the maintenance and evolution of those policies.
MidPoint implements access recertification process.
This is a recurring process that asks managers to confirm that the users still need the privileges that they have previously received.
MidPoint contains mechanism to sort roles into hierarchies and categories.
That is necessary to maintain order during role engineering and maintenance of role definitions.
MidPoint has mechanisms for selective enforcement of role which comes very useful during migrations and when new system is connected to midPoint.
MidPoint has support for policy lifecycle, general policy rules and so on.
And more work in that direction is planned in future midPoint versions.
We fully understand that it is not enough to simply apply the policies.
Policies are living things and they need to evolve.

== Case Study

This book is about practical identity management.
Therefore we will get very close to a practice by demonstrating midPoint features using a case study.
This is a case study of a fictional company ExAmPLE, Inc.
The name stands for "Exemplary Amplified Placeholder Enterprise".
ExAmPLE is a mid-sized financial company.
Its operation heavily relies on information technologies, therefore there is a diverse set of applications and information systems ranging from legacy applications to cloud services.
As ExAmPLE has few thousand employees and there is a good potential for growth the management has decided to start an IAM program.
The first step of the program is deployment of midPoint as the identity management system.

Eric is an IT engineer at ExAmPLE.
He has taken the responsibility to install and configure midPoint.
Eric spins up a new Linux virtual machine for midPoint.
He downloads midPoint distribution package and follows the installation instructions.
Couple of minutes later midPoint instance starts up.
Eric logs in to the midPoint user interface.

image::02-03-dashboard.png[Dashboard]

MidPoint instance is almost empty after fresh installation.
It contains only a couple of essential objects.
But Eric is a smart engineer.
He has already read through this book and he knows exactly what he needs to do.

First thing to do is to populate midPoint with employee data.
The primary source of ExAmPLE employee data is an HR system.
The HR system is quite big piece of software and it is not easy to connect to that system directly.
Fortunately, it is quite easy to get a text export of the employee data in comma-separated (CSV) format.
Eric plans to use this file to get employee data to midPoint.

== Connectors and Resources

MidPoint communicates with all the source and target systems by the means of connectors.
Connectors are relatively small Java components that are plugged into midPoint.
There is usually one connector for each type of the connected system.
Therefore there are connectors for LDAP servers, Active Directory, databases, UNIX operating systems and so on.
The responsibility of a connector is to translate protocols.
E.g. LDAP connector will translate midPoint search commands to LDAP search requests.
The UNIX connector will create an SSH session and translate midPoint create command to the invocation of Linux useradd binary.
And so on.
Each connector talks using its own communication protocol on one side.
But on the other side the connectors translate the information to a common format that is understood by midPoint.

There is no distinction between source and target system when it comes to the connector.
The same connectors are used for source and target systems.
The difference is only in midPoint configuration.

The connectors are distributed as Java binaries (JAR files).
To deploy them to midPoint you just need to place them in the correct directory and restart midPoint.
MidPoint will automatically discover and examine the connectors during start-up.
A handful of frequently used connectors is bundled into midPoint distribution.
These connectors do not need to be deployed.
They are automatically available.

image::02-04-connectors-resources.png[Connectors and resources]

Connector of a specific type works for all the systems that communicate by the protocol supported by connector.
E.g. LDAP connector works for all the LDAP-compliant servers.
Connector is just a very generic piece of code.
It does not know the hostname, port or passwords that are needed to establish a connection to a particular server.
The configuration that specify connection parameters for individual server is stored in special configuration object called _resource_.
The term _resource_ in midPoint terminology generally means any system which is connected to a midPoint instance.

Therefore what Eric the Engineer needs to do to get ExAmPLE employees into midPoint is to define a new resource.
This resource will represent the CSV file exported from the HR system.
MidPoint distribution contains CSV file connector already, therefore there is no need to deploy it explicitly.
All that Eric has to do is to create a new resource definition.
There are (at least) two ways how to do it.
Firstly, there is a configuration wizard in midPoint user interface.
Eric can use the wizard to configure a new resource from scratch.
But as you will see later in this book, the resource definition is quite complex and it has many configuration options.
This makes the configuration wizard very rich and it may be quite confusing for new users.
Therefore it is better for Eric to use the other approach: start from an example.
There are examples of various resource definitions in the midPoint distribution package and even more examples are available on-line.
Therefore Eric quickly locates a XML file that contains a complete example of a CSV resource.
He edits the file to change the filesystem path to his CSV file and adjusts the names of the columns to match the format of his file.
The very minimal resource configuration specifies just the resource name, connector and connector configuration.
The XML file that Eric creates looks approximately like this (simplified for clarity):

.`resource-csv-hr-bare.xml`
[source,xml]
----
<resource oid="03c3ceea-78e2-11e6-954d-dfdfa9ace0cf">
    <name>HR System</name>
    <connectorRef type="ConnectorType"> ...</connectorRef>
    <connectorConfiguration>
        <configurationProperties>
            <filePath>/opt/midpoint/var/resources/hr.csv</filePath>
            <uniqueAttribute>empno</uniqueAttribute>
        </configurationProperties>
     </connectorConfiguration>
</resource>
----

TIP: If you are a hands-on type of engineer you probably want to follow what Eric is doing in your own midPoint instance.
All the files that Eric is using are provided in a form of ready-to-use samples.
Please see <<92-additional-information.adoc#92-additional-information,Additional Information>> chapter at the end of this book for the details.

Then Eric goes to _Configuration_ section of midPoint user interface and imports the XML file into midPoint.
Import operation creates new resource definition in midPoint.
Eric now navigates to _Resources_ section of the midPoint user interface.
The new CSV resource is there.
When Eric clicks on the resource name a resource details screen appears.

image::02-05-resource-hr.png[HR resource]

Eric can click on the button at the bottom of the screen to test connection to the resource.
As this is a local CSV file there is no real connection.
But the test checks that the filesystem path is correct, that the file exists and that it can be opened.
The test also loads _resource schema_.
MidPoint reads the CSV file header to discover the structure of the data in the CSV file.
The resource is now prepared for use.

There is not much that Eric can do with the resource yet.
We need to explain a couple of essential midPoint concepts before moving forward with our case study.

== User and Accounts

The concept of user is perhaps the most important concept in the entire IDM field.
The term _user_ represents physical person: an employee, support engineer, temporary worker, student, customer, etc.
On the other hand the term _account_ refers to the data structure that allows the user to access applications.
This may be an account in the operating system, LDAP entry, row in the database table and so on.
Typically, one user has many accounts – usually one account for each resource.

image::02-06-user-account.png[User and accounts]

The data that represent users are stored directly in midPoint.
While the data that represent accounts are stored "on the resource side".
Which means accounts are stored in the connected applications, databases, directories and operating systems.
Accounts are not stored in midPoint.
Under normal circumstances MidPoint keeps just account identifiers and some meta-data about the accounts.
All other attributes are retrieved when needed.
MidPoint is using the connectors to fetch account data.

We will strictly distinguish the terms _user_ and _account_ in this book.
Such a strong distinction is also made in the midPoint user interface and documentation.
It is very helpful to get used to this terminology.

Accounts are linked to users that own the accounts.
Therefore midPoint knows which account belongs to which user.
MidPoint can list all the accounts for any user, it can synchronize the data, it can disable all the accounts of a particular user and so on.
This user-account _link_ is almost always automatically established and maintained by midPoint.

MidPoint comes with a built-in data model (schema) for users.
It contains properties that are very often used to describe users such as full name, e-mail address and telephone number.
There is a reasonable set of properties that should be a good starting point for most deployments.
Of course, as most midPoint objects, the user schema can be extended with custom properties if needed.

However, there is no built-in data model for accounts.
Such data model would not be possible.
Every resource may have different account attributes.
There may be different names, different types and the values may have different meaning.
MidPoint is designed to handle those differences.
Schema for resource accounts is dynamically discovered when midPoint connects to the resource for the first time.
MidPoint interprets the schema and automatically adapts to it.
E.g. when midPoint displays information about an account, the user interface fields are dynamically generated from the discovered schema.
MidPoint does that all by itself.
No extra configuration and no coding is necessary.

_Account schema_ may significantly differ from resource to resource.
Yet midPoint must be able to synchronize all the accounts from any kind of resource imaginable.
In this case the _user schema_ works as a unified data model.
The schema of each account is mapped to the user schema.

image::02-07-user-account-mapping.png[User-account mapping]

Getting back to our ExAmPLE story, Eric has a HR resource configured.
Therefore he can see the "accounts" that the users have in the HR system.
Eric opens the resource detail page in the midPoint GUI, clicks on menu:Accounts[] tab and then on the btn:[Resource] button (we'll explain that later).
The list of accounts appears:

image::02-08-resource-hr-accounts.png[Resource HR accounts]

All that can be seen in this list are just employee numbers, because employee number is set as the primary identifier for the HR system.
Clicking on the link will display more details.
In fact these are not real accounts.
These are lines in the CSV file exported from the HR database.
But they describe some aspects of _identity_ and therefore midPoint interprets them as accounts.
For midPoint "account" is a generic term used to describe any resource-side data structure that represents the user.

== Initial Import

The _user_ is a central concept for any IDM system and midPoint is no exception.
MidPoint needs reliable information about users to work correctly it.
The HR system is usually a good source of user information.
Eric needs to get that information from the HR system into midPoint.
He has already set up a resource that connects to the CSV file exported from the HR system.
But the resource does not do anything by default.
It has to be configured to pull the information from the file into midPoint.
What Eric needs is a set of _mappings_.
Mapping is a mechanism for synchronization of attribute values between user and linked accounts.
In this case Eric needs _inbound_ mappings to import the data.
Inbound mappings synchronize the value in the direction from the resource into midPoint.
Eric can open the resource definition in the configuration wizard in GUI and he can add the mappings there.
Or he can simply look at the configuration samples again and add the mappings in the XML form.
Inbound mapping looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
    <attribute>
        <ref>ri:firstname</ref>
        <inbound>
            <target>
                <path>givenName</path>
            </target>
        </inbound>
   </attribute>
----

This is a mapping that maps the account (HR) attribute `firstname` to user (midPoint) property `givenName`.
This tells midPoint to always update a value of user's given name when the mapped HR attribute changes.
Eric adds similar mappings for all the attributes in the HR export file.
Eric also needs to add _synchronization_ section to the resource definition.
The synchronization section instructs midPoint to create a new user for each new account.
This is exactly what Eric wants: create a user for each HR account.
Eric then re-imports the modified XML file into midPoint.

TIP: For the curious and impatient readers, complete definition of HR resource is stored in `resource-csv-hr.xml` file in book samples.
Please see <<92-additional-information.adoc#92-additional-information,Additional Information>> chapter for the details.

MidPoint is now ready to synchronize the attributes.
But we still need a _task_ to pull all the data from the HR system.
Eric navigates to the page that shows the list of HR accounts.
At the bottom of that page there is a big btn:[Import] button that can be used to manage the import tasks.
Eric clicks on that button and creates a new import task.
The task is started, and it runs for a couple of seconds.
After the task is done Eric can look at users in midPoint:

image::02-09-users.png[Users]

Eric can see details about the user by clicking on the username:

image::02-10-user-details.png[User details]

This page shows all the details about the user that midPoint knows about.
The details are sorted to several tabs, and we are going to explain all of that later in this book.
For now, we only care about first two tabs.
The menu:Basic[] tab shows user properties as midPoint knows them.
These properties are stored in midPoint repository.
MidPoint has quite a rich data model that can be used out-of-the-box, but the GUI only shows those properties that are actually used.
The "name", given name and family name were imported from the HR resource and that's what the page shows.

Let's have a look at the second tab now:

image::02-11-user-projections.png[User projections]

The menu:Projections[] tab shows user's accounts.
Currently, there is only one account.
It is the HR account that was used to import the data.
Account details are displayed by clicking on account identifier:

image::02-12-user-projection-hr.png[User HR projection]

The data that are displayed here are really fresh.
Account details were retrieved from the resource at the very moment that the account was displayed.
This is the difference between user data and account data: user data are kept in midPoint repository, while account data are retrieved from the resource as needed.

The user and the account are linked.
MidPoint remembers that this user originated from this specific HR account.
If the HR account is modified then the change is synchronized and applied to the user data.
The mappings are not just for the import.
They can work continually and keep the account and user data synchronized all the time.

== Assignments and Projections

The concepts of an account is all about the reality: it shows the data that are there at this very moment.
It shows what _is_ there.
But identity management is all about policies.
Policies, by definition, specify what _should be_ there.
Policies specify what is right.
But as every citizen knows all too well, the things that _are_ and the things that _should be_ do not always match perfectly.
We are no idealists.
Therefore we have designed midPoint from the day one to acknowledge that there may be a difference between reality and policy.
Primary role of midPoint is to manage that difference.
And completely align policy and reality in the long run.

This kind of thinking is easy to see in midPoint user interface.
There is menu:Projections[] tab in the user details page.
It shows the accounts that the user has right now.
It shows the real state in which the accounts are.
It shows the reality.
And then there is menu:Assignments[] tab.
This tab shows the policy.
This tab shows what accounts, roles, organizations, or services are assigned to the user.
This tab shows what user should have.

image::02-13-assignments-empty.png[Assignments]

To demonstrate how the assignments work we need a new resource.
Therefore, let Eric connect a new resource to midPoint.
This time it will be new, clean and empty LDAP server.
So Eric once again locates the proper example, modifies the configuration and imports it to midPoint.
In a while there is a new LDAP resource.
Eric wants to synchronize all the users to the LDAP server.
To do that, Eric has to define mappings once again.
But this time these will be _outbound_ mappings as Eric wants to propagate data out of midPoint into the (LDAP) resource.
We will cover the details of mapping configuration later, so now let's just see the results.
We have two resources now:

image::02-14-resources.png[Resources]

But how do we create an account on that LDAP resource?
The right way to do this is to let midPoint know that a user _should have_ an account on that resource.
In midPoint terminology we say, that we are _assigning_ the resource to the user.
All that Eric needs to do is to navigate to user details page, click on the _Assignments_ tab, use _New assignment_ button to add an assignment for the LDAP resource and click _Save_:

image::02-15-assign-ldap.png[Assign LDAP account]

After the click on _Save_ button a lot of complex things happen.
But simply speaking midPoint recomputes what the user should have and what the user has.
MidPoint detects that the user should have an LDAP account now (because there is a new assignment for it).
But no such account exists.
Therefore midPoint creates the account.

When Eric opens the user details again and navigates to the _Projections_ tab he can see that there are two accounts now:

image::02-16-user-projections-2.png[User projections]

There is an HR account that was used to create the user in the first place.
And there is also LDAP account that was created as a reaction to a new assignment.

image::02-17-user-projection-ldap.png[User LDAP projection]

TIP: Careful reader may have noticed that the two accounts have vastly different attributes.
That's right.
Every account has a different _schema_.
MidPoint automatically discovers the schema.
Then midPoint dynamically interprets the schema to display the attributes in GUI, to validate the inputs, to check for errors in mappings and so on.
MidPoint does everything by itself without any need to write a single line of code.
MidPoint is completely based on the concept of schema and it takes full advantage of it.

There is reality and there is policy.
There are accounts and there are assignments.
Ideally these two things should match perfectly.
And midPoint will try really hard to make them match.
But there may be exceptions.
Careful reader surely noticed that there is HR account but there is no assignment for that account.
And yet midPoint has not deleted the HR account.
That is because the HR system is what we call a "pure source" system.
MidPoint does not write to the HR, it only reads from it.
Writes to the CSV export file would be overwritten by the next export anyway, so there is no point in writing there.
Therefore the HR resource has an exception specified in its configuration: it allows the HR account to exist even if there is no assignment for it.
We can keep the HR account linked to the user by using this method.
We can see the data that were used to create the user.
This improves overall visibility and it greatly helps with diagnostics of configuration issues.

== Roles

It would be a daunting task if Eric had to assign every individual account for every individual resource to every user.
Typical IDM deployment has thousands of users and dozens of resources.
Such deployment would be very difficult to manage using only direct resource assignments.

But there is a better way, of course.
We can define some _roles_.
The concept of _role-based access control (RBAC)_ is a well-established practice and the roles are really the bread-and-butter of identity management.
The basic idea of RBAC is to group privileges into roles.
Then the roles are assigned to the users instead of privileges.
E.g. let's create a `Webmaster` role.
Then put all the privileges that webmaster should have into that role.
And let's assign the role to every user that works as a webmaster.
This simplifies the privilege management.
If there are two webmasters there is no need to think about the individual privileges that a webmaster should have.
Just assign the role and the role has everything that is needed.
It is also easy to change webmasters: unassign role from one user, assign to another user.
It is also easy if you add a new web server.
Just add the privilege for accessing new server into the `Webmaster` role.
And all webmasters will have it.

That's the theory.
But how does it work for Eric?
First of all let's add a handful of new resources – to get some material for the roles.
So now we have four resources: HR, LDAP, CRM and Portal.
That’s a good start.
Let’s do some role engineering now.

Many organizations have one role that almost every user has.
It is often `Employee` or `Staff` role.
This role gives access to all the systems that an employee should have access to: Windows domain login, e-mail, employee portal – things like that.
The ExAmPLE company is no exception.
In this case the basic role should create accounts in two systems:

* *LDAP server:* many applications are connected to LDAP and use it for authentication.
We want every ExAmPLE employee to have account there.

* *Portal:* this is enterprise intranet portal with lots of small services essential for every employee.

It is simple to create such role in midPoint user interface.
Eric navigates to _Roles > New role_.
Fills in the name of the new role (`Employee`).
Then he goes to the _Inducements_ tab.
This is where the role definition takes place.
Inducements are almost the same as assignments.
However, inducements do not give access to the role itself.
Inducements give access to the users that have this role.
So they are kind of indirect assignments.
Eric clicks on _New inducement_ button and adds inducements for the two resources into the role:

image::02-18-role-employee-inducements.png[Role Employee inducements]

Eric clicks on _Save_ button and the new role is created.
Now it is ready to be assigned to the users.
Eric goes on and assigns `Employee` role to user Bob:

image::02-19-user-bob-employee.png[Employee Bob]

MidPoint automatically creates all the accounts given by the role:

image::02-20-user-bob-accounts.png[Employee Bob accounts]

There is the HR account that was used to create the Bob user record in the first place.
And then there are the two accounts that were created because Bob has the `Employee` role.

This operation works in both directions: if Eric unassigns the `Employee` role, the accounts given by the role will be deleted.
Eric can create any number of roles like this: roles for Sales agents with CRM access, roles for Sales managers with higher CRM privileges and so on.
MidPoint is designed to handle large number of roles.
Each role can have its own combination of resources.
MidPoint seamlessly merges the privileges given by all the roles a user has.
E.g. if two roles give CRM access to the user, only one CRM account will be created.
If one of these roles is unassigned then CRM account remains there.
The account is not deleted yet because it is given by the other role.
Only when the last CRM role is removed that’s the point where the account gets deleted.
MidPoint takes care of all that logic.

Of course, there is much more that the roles can do:

* Roles can assign accounts to groups, give the privileges and manage account entitlements.

* Roles can mandate specific account attribute values, e.g. clearance levels, compartments, etc.

* Roles may contain custom logic (scripts).

* Roles may be hierarchical: there may be roles within roles.

* Roles may be assigned for a specified time.

* Roles may be conditional and parametric.

* ... and much much more.

Roles are really the essence of identity management.
We will be dealing with roles in almost all the parts of this book.

== There Is Much More

Eric the Engineer has done a few basic steps to configure midPoint as an identity management system for his company.
But this is still a very basic configuration.
Careful readers have already noticed a lot of things that need to be done.
E.g. employee full name is not automatically generated.
Employee numbers are used as identifiers and we would like to have something that is more user-friendly.
We would like to automatically assign the `Employee` role instead of doing that manually.
And so on.
There are still a lot of things to improve.
Fortunately, all of that is very easy to do with midPoint once you know where to look.
And we will be dealing with all these things in the rest of this book.
New functionality will be administered to the ExAmPLE solution in small doses in each chapter – together with a proper explanation of midPoint principles.
MidPoint is a very flexible and comprehensive system and there are still a lot of things to learn.
This chapter covered only a minuscule part of midPoint functionality.

== What MidPoint Is Not

Now you probably have some idea what midPoint is.
However, it is also very important to understand what midPoint is not.
Identity and Access Management (IAM) field is a combination of many technologies and it may sometimes be quite confusing.
That is perhaps the reason why the midPoint team occasionally gets questions about midPoint functionality that simply do not make much sense.

First of all, midPoint is not an authentication server.
MidPoint is not designed to validate your username and password.
Yes, midPoint maintains data about users (including passwords).
But the data model that midPoint maintains is quite complex.
It is not meant to be exposed to applications directly.
That would not be efficient.

If you want midPoint to manage users but you also want your applications to have a centralized authentication services there is a solution: publish the data to the LDAP server.
Connect LDAP server to midPoint as a resource and let midPoint populate and maintain the LDAP sever data.
The application will not talk to midPoint directly.
They will talk to the LDAP server.
This is better for everybody: LDAP is a standard protocol well supported in many applications.
LDAP servers are also extremely fast and scalable ad nauseam.
Therefore use the combination of midPoint and an LDAP server of your choice.
That’s what people usually do and it works perfectly.

As midPoint is not an authentication server it obviously is not a Single Sign-On (SSO) server either.
If you want SSO you will need a dedicated SSO server.
There are plenty of SSO servers to choose from in both the closed-source and open-source worlds.
You will also need a scalable directory system (LDAP) to store the data for the SSO server.
And you will probably still need midPoint to manage the data.

One of the things that seems to be shrouded in a lot of confusion is authorization.
To get the record straight from the beginning: midPoint is not an authorization server.
It is not a policy decision point (PDP) and it definitely is not a policy enforcement point (PEP).
You cannot rip authorization out of your application and just “use midPoint for that”.
That does not work.

You can think of midPoint as a policy management point (PMP).
MidPoint has a lot of sophisticated authorization-related logic inside its core.
But that logic is not designed to answer questions such as "Is subject S authorized to execute operation O on object X?".
MidPoint logic is different.
MidPoint is not concerned with making authorization decisions.
It is concerned about managing the authorization policies.
MidPoint sets up the authorization policies in target applications.
And the applications evaluate these policies themselves.
This is a much more efficient and more reliable method.
Unlike authentication, the authorizations decisions are done all the time.
Authorization is evaluated at least once per every request.
If the application makes these decision internally then there is no need to a round-trip to the authorization server.
Performance is significantly increased.
And there is no single point of failure.
MidPoint failure will not interrupt authorization flow because the application has all the data inside.
One less component to cause a failure.
And still, the policies are centrally managed by midPoint.
When a policy changes midPoint updates all the affected applications.
You get all the benefits without the usual drawbacks.

MidPoint does what it is supposed to do: it _manages_ identities, entitlements, organizational structures and policies.
But midPoint does not do things that are not necessary.
It does not do the things that other technologies already do well.
MidPoint does not reinvent the wheel.
There is no need for this.
MidPoint is not the wheel.
MidPoint sits above all the wheels.
MidPoint is the chauffeur.
